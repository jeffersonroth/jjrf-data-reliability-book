<p>When discussing data reliability engineering, a data system encompasses the entire ecosystem that supports the data lifecycle, which includes data creation, storage, retrieval, and usage. A comprehensive data system considers redundancy, fault tolerance, backup procedures, security measures, and regular maintenance practices. All of these elements contribute to the overall reliability of the system and the trustworthiness of its service.</p>
<p>Various fields may have slightly different interpretations or emphasize different aspects of data systems, but here are some common definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Information Technology (IT) and Computer Science</strong>:
In these fields, a data system is often viewed as a software and hardware infrastructure designed to collect, store, manage, process, and analyze data. This encompasses databases, data warehouses, big data systems, and data processing frameworks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Business and Enterprise</strong>:
From a business perspective, a data system is considered an essential part of the organization's information system strategy, supporting decision-making, operations, and management.

<div>
<p>This book defines systems reliability by its adherence to a clear, complete, consistent, and unambiguous behavior specification.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This definition applies to both <strong>Systems Reliability</strong> and <strong>Data Systems Reliability</strong>, as systems reliability refers to the ability of a system, which can be mechanical, electrical, software, or any other engineered system, to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time without failure.
It encompasses a wide range of systems, from simple tools to complex networks like power grids or transportation systems.
The focus is on ensuring the entire system operates reliably, including its hardware, software, human operators, and the interactions between these components.
Reliability in this context involves redundancy, fault tolerance, maintainability, and robustness against various failure modes.</p>
<p>Data systems reliability pertains explicitly to the reliability of systems that handle data, such as databases, data warehouses, data pipelines, and big data platforms.
Data systems reliability focuses on ensuring that these systems can accurately store, process, and retrieve data as expected, without loss, corruption, or unacceptable performance degradation.
This involves not only the reliability of the software and hardware components but also aspects like data integrity, data security, backup and recovery processes, and the consistency of data across distributed systems.</p>
<h2 id="reliability-engineering-vs-data-reliability-engineering-vs-data-reliability"><a class="header" href="#reliability-engineering-vs-data-reliability-engineering-vs-data-reliability">Reliability Engineering vs. Data Reliability Engineering (vs. Data Reliability)</a></h2>
<p><strong>Reliability Engineering</strong> and <strong>Data Reliability Engineering</strong> share a common foundation in the principles of reliability and engineering but diverge in their specific domains and challenges.
Reliability Engineering spans various engineering disciplines, ensuring systems perform reliably under specified conditions.
This involves analyzing potential failures, enhancing designs for robustness, and implementing redundancy and fault tolerance.
Reliability engineers employ a range of tools, such as failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), reliability block diagrams (RBD), fault tree analysis, and statistical reliability analysis, to predict and enhance the reliability of both physical and software systems.</p>
<p>On the other hand, data reliability engineering is specifically concerned with the reliability of data systems, such as databases, data warehouses, data lakes, and data pipelines.
It focuses on maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and availability of data within these systems, addressing challenges like data corruption, loss, duplication, and inconsistencies across distributed systems.
Ensuring that data pipelines accurately process and deliver data as intended is a key aspect of this role.
Data reliability engineers adopt practices including comprehensive data testing, continuous data quality monitoring, the construction of resilient data pipelines, the implementation of robust backup and recovery systems, and the maintenance of data integrity across distributed systems.</p>
<p>While reliability engineering broadly addresses the reliability of diverse systems, focusing on their physical and functional aspects, data reliability engineering is specifically dedicated to the reliability of systems that handle and process data, ensuring data remains trustworthy and accessible.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>The <a href="concepts/data-architecture/./n_tier_architecture.html">N-tier architecture</a> architecture expands upon the three-tier model by introducing additional layers or tiers, allowing for greater separation of concerns, scalability, and flexibility.
Each tier is dedicated to a specific function, such as presentation, application processing, business logic, and data management, with the potential for further subdivisions to address specific scalability or functionality requirements.</p>

<p>Single-tier architecture, often referred to as a <strong>monolithic architecture</strong>, is a software application model where the user interface, business logic, and data storage layers are combined into a single program or platform that runs on a single platform or server.</p>
<div id="admonition-single-tier-architecture" class="admonition admonish-tip">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Single-Tier Architecture</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/data-architecture/single_tier_architecture.html#admonition-single-tier-architecture"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This architecture is characterized by its simplicity and is often used for smaller applications or systems where scalability, high availability, and distributed processing are not primary concerns.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Characteristics of Single-Tier Architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Because all components are housed within a single layer or platform, the architecture is straightforward to develop, deploy, and manage.</li>
<li><strong>Tight Coupling</strong>: The application's components and layers (UI, business logic, and data storage) are tightly coupled, so changes to one component can potentially impact others.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Deployment</strong>: Deployment is generally simpler since there's only one application to deploy, without the need to manage communication between separate layers or services.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Scalability</strong>: Scaling the application typically means scaling the entire application stack together, which can be inefficient and costly, especially for larger applications.</li>
<li><strong>Single Point of Failure</strong>: The entire application resides on a single server or platform, making it vulnerable to a single point of failure that can make the entire application unavailable in case of a server failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>When discussing single-tier architecture in data systems, the focus shifts to systems where data storage, management, and processing occur within a single environment or platform.
Here are some examples tailored to data systems:</p>
<div id="admonition-local-database-systems" class="admonition admonish-example">

<p>Local Database Systems</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/data-architecture/single_tier_architecture.html#admonition-local-database-systems"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Small-scale applications, like a standalone desktop application used for inventory management or personal finance, employ a single-tier architecture by integrating a local database system (e.g., SQLite) within the application.
The application directly interacts with this local database for all data storage, retrieval, and processing needs without relying on external services or layers.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Many smart devices or IoT (Internet of Things) devices use single-tier architecture for data handling.
For instance, a smart thermostat might collect, process, and store data about temperature preferences, usage patterns, and environmental data all within the device itself using an embedded database.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>In some small businesses or personal projects, spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets can serve as a single-tier data system.
Users can input data, use built-in functions for data processing and analysis, and store the information within the spreadsheet file.
While not a "database" in the traditional sense, this setup functions as a single-tier data system for many basic applications.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Some minimalistic web applications use file-based data storage (such as JSON, XML files, or even plain text files) to store data directly on the server's filesystem.
These applications handle data storage, processing, and presentation in a single layer without the need for separate database management systems.</p>

<div>
<p>Tools designed for specific data analysis tasks, such as log file analyzers or small-scale data visualization tools, might encapsulate data ingestion, processing, and visualization within a single application.
Users can load data files into the tool, which then processes and presents the analysis or visualizations without relying on external systems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Single-tier architectures in data systems are characterized by their simplicity and self-contained nature, making them suitable for applications with limited scalability requirements and where ease of deployment and management are priorities.
However, as data needs grow in complexity and volume, the limitations of single-tier architectures, such as scalability challenges and the difficulty of managing complex data processing tasks, often necessitate moving to more layered, distributed architectures.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Two-tier architectures balance simplicity and separation of concerns, making them suitable for applications where the direct client-server model suffices.
However, for more complex applications requiring greater scalability, flexibility, and separation of concerns, developers might opt for multi-tier architectures such as three-tier or n-tier models.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Two-tier architecture in the context of data systems is a client-server model that divides the system into two main layers or tiers: the client tier (presentation layer) and the server tier (data layer).
This architecture is a step towards separating concerns, which improves scalability and manageability compared to single-tier systems.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Two-Tier Architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client Tier</strong>: This is the front-end layer where the user interface resides. The client application handles user interactions, presents data to the users, and may perform some data processing. It communicates directly with the server tier for data operations.</li>
<li><strong>Server Tier</strong>: This tier consists of the server that hosts the database management system (DBMS). It is responsible for data storage, retrieval, and business logic processing. The server tier interacts with the client tier to serve data requests and execute database operations.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Communication</strong>: In a two-tier architecture, the client application communicates directly with the database server without intermediate layers. This direct communication can simplify the architecture but might limit scalability and flexibility in more complex applications.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: While two-tier architecture offers better scalability than single-tier by separating the client and server, it still faces challenges in scaling horizontally, especially as the number of clients increases.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance</strong>: Updates and maintenance might need to be performed separately on both tiers, but the clear separation makes it easier to manage than a single-tier system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of Two-Tier Architecture in Data Systems:</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>A typical example of a two-tier architecture is a desktop application that connects directly to a database server. Applications like Microsoft Access, where the application on the user's desktop interacts with a centralized database server, are typical examples. This setup allows users to query and manipulate data stored on a remote server while using a local, user-friendly interface.</p>

<h2 id="use-case"><a class="header" href="#use-case">Use Case</a></h2>
<p>At Opetence Inc., an analytics team has access to an Aurora Postgres instance, where Fivetran loads data directly from microservices' databases, third-party data (Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, etc.), and some Google Sheets files.
The analytics team transforms the data using SQL queries directly in the same database, creating "marts" in the same database to which Tableau connects.
The microservices' database data is loaded every 5 minutes, and the data in Auroras Postgres instance is used to monitor near real-time operations.</p>
<p>The scenario described can be considered a variation of the two-tier architecture, with some elements that expand beyond the traditional definition. Here's a breakdown of how it aligns with and diverges from classic two-tier architecture:</p>
<p><strong>Alignment with Two-Tier Architecture</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client-Server Model</strong>: The analytics team (client) interacts directly with the Aurora Postgres instance (server). This direct interaction is a hallmark of two-tier architecture, where the client accesses the database server without intermediary layers.</li>
<li><strong>Data Transformation and Analysis</strong>: The analytics team uses SQL queries to transform data and create data marts within the same Aurora Postgres database instance, which is akin to business logic being processed in the server tier and is consistent with two-tier architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Connection to Visualization Tools</strong>: Connecting Tableau directly to the data marts within the Aurora Postgres instance for visualization also aligns with the two-tier model, where the client application (Tableau) directly accesses the data layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expansions Beyond Traditional Two-Tier</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Ingestion Automation</strong>: Using Fivetran to automatically load data from various sources (microservices' databases, third-party data, and Google Sheets) into the Aurora Postgres instance introduces an element of automation and integration that isn't typically a focus in classic two-tier descriptions. This aspect leans towards more sophisticated data pipeline and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes that are often part of more layered architectures.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Data Monitoring</strong>: The requirement for near real-time operations monitoring implies a level of dynamic data handling and updating that may exceed the simplicity often associated with two-tier systems. This aspect suggests a need for real-time data processing and analysis capabilities that are more characteristic of advanced data architectures.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the core of the described scenario—direct interaction between the analytics team (client) and the Aurora Postgres instance (server)—fits the two-tier architecture model, the automated data ingestion and real-time monitoring aspects introduce complexities that are often addressed with more layered architectural approaches.
Therefore, this scenario could be seen as a two-tier architecture at its foundation, with extensions that incorporate elements typically found in more advanced, multi-tier architectures.</p>
<p>However, while this setup facilitates direct data manipulation and reporting, it does introduce several challenges and potential issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance Bottlenecks</strong>: Having all transformations, data loading, and analytics operations directly on the Aurora Postgres instance can lead to performance bottlenecks. Continuous data loading from microservices and third-party sources every 5 minutes, coupled with complex SQL queries for transformations and data mart creation, can strain the database, affecting its responsiveness and the performance of applications relying on it, such as Tableau dashboards.</li>
<li><strong>Security and Access Control</strong>: Direct access to the database for multiple tools and the analytics team can pose significant security risks, especially if sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) is involved. Ensuring proper access controls and preventing unauthorized access becomes challenging when multiple clients interact directly with the database.
<ul>
<li><strong>Fivetran and Tableau Access</strong>: These tools, which have direct access to the database, might not always adhere to the principle of least privilege, potentially exposing sensitive data.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics Team Access to Raw Data</strong>: Having unrestrained access to raw data, including PII, increases the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Governance and Quality</strong>: With transformations and mart creation done directly in the production database, maintaining data quality and governance standards becomes complex. Without a separate layer for handling ETL/ELT processes and data cleansing, there's a risk of data inconsistencies, duplication, or errors propagating through the analytics and reporting layers.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability Issues</strong>: As data volume grows and the number of microservices and third-party data sources increases, the system may struggle to scale efficiently. The direct and constant load on the Aurora instance might not sustainably support larger datasets or more complex analytics requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Isolation Between Operational and Analytical Workloads</strong>: Mixing operational and analytical workloads in a single database instance can lead to resource contention, where analytical queries compete with operational transactions for CPU, memory, and I/O resources, potentially degrading the performance of both workloads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations for Addressing These Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implement a Data Lake or Data Warehouse</strong>: Consider introducing an intermediate storage layer, such as a data lake or a dedicated data warehouse, to decouple raw data ingestion from transformation and analytics workloads. This can help manage performance, improve security, and enhance scalability.</li>
<li><strong>Data Governance Framework</strong>: Establish a robust data governance framework with clear policies on data access, quality, security, and compliance. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users and applications only have access to the data they are authorized to use.</li>
<li><strong>Use a Dedicated ETL/ELT Tool</strong>: Use a dedicated ETL/ELT tool or platform to manage data transformations and loading processes. This can help isolate and optimize data processing workloads, improving maintainability and performance.</li>
<li><strong>Implement Data Masking or Anonymization for PII</strong>: For sensitive or PII data, employ data masking, anonymization, or pseudonymization techniques before making the data available to the analytics team or third-party tools.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Optimization</strong>: Regularly monitor the performance of the database and the analytics processes. Use query optimization, indexing, and partitioning strategies to improve performance and manage workload demands effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adopting these recommendations can help mitigate the identified problems, leading to a more secure, scalable, and performant data architecture.</p>

<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/data-architecture/three_tier_architecture.html#admonition-three-tier-architecture"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This model enhances application performance, scalability, maintainability, and security by segregating functionalities into distinct layers that interact with each other through well-defined interfaces.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Three-tier architecture is a widely adopted software design pattern that separates applications into three logical and physical computing tiers: the Presentation tier, the Application (or Logic) tier, and the Data tier.</p>
<p>Three-Tier Architecture Components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presentation Tier (Client Tier)</strong>: This is the topmost level of the application and is the interface through which users interact with the application. It's responsible for presenting data to users and interpreting user commands. This tier can be a web browser, a desktop application, or a mobile app.</li>
<li><strong>Application Tier (Logic Tier/Business Logic Tier)</strong>: The middle tier is an intermediary between the presentation and data tiers. It contains the application's business logic and rules, which process user requests, perform operations on the data, and determine how data should be structured or presented. This tier can run on a server and be developed in any language, such as Rust, Go, or Python.</li>
<li><strong>Data Tier (Database Tier)</strong>: The bottom tier consists of the database management system (DBMS), which is responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing the data within the system. It can include relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL or non-relational databases like MongoDB.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages of Three-Tier Architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Each tier can be scaled independently, allowing for more efficient resource use and the ability to handle increased loads by scaling the most resource-intensive components.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: Separation of concerns makes updating or modifying one tier easier without affecting others, simplifying maintenance and updates.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Layered architecture allows for more granular control over access and security. Security measures can be applied independently at each tier, such as securing sensitive business logic in the application tier and implementing database access controls in the data tier.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility and Reusability</strong>: The application tier can serve as a centralized location for business logic, making it easier to reuse logic across different applications and integrate with different databases or presentation tiers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider an online retail platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presentation Tier</strong>: The e-commerce website and mobile app through which customers browse products, add items to their shopping cart, and place orders.</li>
<li><strong>Application Tier</strong>: The backend server that processes customer orders, manages inventory, applies business rules (like discounts, taxes, stock availability), and handles user authentication and authorization.</li>
<li><strong>Data Tier</strong>: The database(s) that store product information, customer data, order history, inventory levels, and other persistent data required by the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario, the three-tier architecture allows the platform to handle user interactions via the web or mobile interfaces efficiently, process business logic on the server, and manage data in a secure and organized manner, facilitating a seamless and scalable e-commerce experience.</p>

<h2 id="use-case-1"><a class="header" href="#use-case-1">Use Case</a></h2>
<p>The same company as the two-tier architecture <a href="concepts/data-architecture/./two_tier_architecture.html#use-case">use case</a>, Opetence Inc., expands the data team by hiring a data engineer.
The data engineer warns the company about the issues described in the previous use case and is authorized to create an Aurora Postgres instance (Data Engineering instance) to store raw and 3rd party data.</p>
<p>Fivetran now loads data directly from microservices' databases, third-party data (Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, etc.), and some Google Sheets files onto the instance in a database named Fivetran.
Some data partners can also store data directly in the DE instance, each in its exclusive database (e.g., Braze database).</p>
<p>The data engineer cleans and anonymizes the data and makes it available in the DE instance in a database called Staging.
The staging data is organized in schemas (<code>order_service</code>, <code>product_service</code>, etc., and <code>google_analytics</code>, <code>facebook_ads</code>, etc.).
The data engineer makes some of these schemas available in the Analytics Aurora Postgres instance as external schemas.
The analytics team has usage permissions to see the data structure but can't select from it.</p>
<p>The analytics team transforms the external data in the Analytics database using dbt, creating the "marts."
Tableau still has access to the Analytics database, but there's no raw data or PII anymore.</p>
<p>Only the microservices data needed for near real-time operations monitoring are frequently fetched into the Operations database in the DE instance, using a self-deployed Airbyte platform connected directly to the microservices' databases.
The migrations tasks are not of type full load and only maintain the time window needed for monitoring.
A dbt model runs in the Operations database, transforming the data into the desired format for monitoring purposes.</p>
<p>The revised use case provides a clearer depiction of a three-tier architecture within a data-centric environment, with distinct separation and specialization at each layer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Layer (Tier 1)</strong>: The "Data Engineering (DE) instance" serves as the foundational layer. It comprises various databases for different data sources:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Fivetran database</strong> for data loaded from microservices, third-party sources like Google Analytics and Facebook Ads, and Google Sheets files.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusive databases</strong> for data from specific partners like Braze, ensuring data segregation and security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Application Logic Layer (Tier 2)</strong>: This tier is responsible for data processing, cleaning, and preparation:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Staging database</strong> within the DE instance, where cleaned and anonymized data is organized into schemas based on their source or service (e.g., order_service, product_service, google_analytics, facebook_ads).</li>
<li>Selected schemas are made available in the <strong>Analytics Aurora Postgres instance</strong> as external schemas, which the analytics team can access but not modify, ensuring data integrity and security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Presentation Layer (Tier 3)</strong>: This tier focuses on data consumption, analysis, and visualization:
<ul>
<li>The analytics team uses <strong>dbt</strong> within the Analytics database to transform external schema data into "marts" tailored for specific analytical needs.</li>
<li><strong>Tableau</strong> connects to these data marts in the Analytics database for reporting and visualization, free from raw data or PII, addressing previous security concerns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operational Data Handling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Operations database</strong> within the DE instance is designated explicitly for monitoring near real-time operations. Data required for this purpose is fetched from microservices databases using <strong>Airbyte</strong>, a flexible, self-hosted data integration platform. This setup provides a dedicated space for operational data, separate from the analytical processing environment, enhancing system efficiency and focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of This Revised Architecture</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Data Security and Governance</strong>: The clear separation between raw data ingestion, processing, and consumption layers helps enforce stricter access controls and data governance policies, particularly by segregating sensitive and PII data from broader access.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Scalability and Flexibility</strong>: This architecture allows for more scalable data processing and analysis workflows. By isolating data transformation and analytics processes, it's easier to scale resources up or down as needed for each tier without impacting other areas of the system.</li>
<li><strong>Dedicated Monitoring and Operations</strong>: The introduction of a specialized Operations database for monitoring ensures that operational analytics don't burden the main analytical processes, allowing for optimized performance in both areas.</li>
<li><strong>Cleaner Data for Analytics</strong>: By cleaning and anonymizing data before it reaches the Analytics instance and further transforming it with dbt, the analytics team works with high-quality data, leading to more reliable insights and reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>This use case is a more refined example of three-tier architecture in a data environment, with clear boundaries between data ingestion and storage, data processing and staging, and data analysis and presentation.
It addresses many of the performance, security, and scalability concerns presented in the original scenario, illustrating the benefits of a well-structured data architecture in supporting efficient and secure data operations.</p>
<p>The data engineer understands the current setup is not optimal, and the company is still far from migrating to a better solution, but separating data and application logic tiers was a win.
However, identifying flaws in the current data management scenario is crucial for making a solid case for migration to a more structured and scalable solution like a data lake or data warehouse.
Here are some potential risks and issues that could be present in the current scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Silos</strong>: Disparate data systems can lead to data silos, making it difficult to access, share, and analyze data across different departments or teams. This lack of integration can hinder collaboration and decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability Issues</strong>: The current infrastructure may not be scalable enough to handle increasing volumes of data, leading to performance bottlenecks and reduced efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Data Quality Concerns</strong>: Ensuring data quality can be challenging without a centralized system. Inconsistent data formats, duplicates, and errors can proliferate, affecting the reliability of data insights.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Data Governance</strong>: The absence of a robust data governance framework can lead to issues with data security, privacy, and compliance, especially with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.</li>
<li><strong>Inefficient Data Processing</strong>: Relying on manual processes or outdated technology for data integration, transformation, and loading (ETL) can be time-consuming and error-prone.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis and Reporting Limitations</strong>: Limited capabilities for advanced analytics, real-time reporting, and data visualization can restrict the ability to derive actionable insights from data.</li>
<li><strong>Data Security Vulnerabilities</strong>: The current setup might have security gaps, making sensitive data susceptible to breaches and unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong>Disaster Recovery Concerns</strong>: An inadequate backup and disaster recovery strategy could mean that critical data is at risk of being lost or compromised in the event of a system failure or cyberattack.</li>
<li><strong>High Maintenance Costs</strong>: In terms of infrastructure and manpower, maintaining multiple disparate systems can be more costly than managing a centralized data repository.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Support for New Technologies</strong>: The existing infrastructure may not support the integration of modern data processing and analytics tools, hindering the adoption of cutting-edge technologies like AI and machine learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing these issues in a comprehensive assessment can help build a compelling argument for migrating to a more modern data management solution.
Highlighting the potential for improved efficiency, better decision-making, and enhanced data security can be particularly persuasive in gaining approval for the transition.</p>
<p>If the company is not ready to adopt a data lake or data warehouse solution and prefers to continue utilizing Aurora Postgres reserved instances, the data engineer can still implement several strategies to optimize the current architecture, leveraging the flexibility of microservices and the existing database infrastructure.
Here are some changes and enhancements that could be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Database Partitioning and Sharding</strong>: Implement database partitioning to divide large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces, improving query performance. Sharding, or distributing data across multiple databases or instances, can also help balance the load and improve scalability.</li>
<li><strong>Microservices for Data Processing</strong>: Utilize microservices architecture for specific data processing tasks. For instance, microservices can be created to perform data cleansing, transformation, and anonymization tasks before the data is ingested into staging or analytics databases. This can offload some processing from the databases and improve overall system efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Caching Strategies</strong>: Implement caching layers within the data architecture to store frequently accessed data and reduce direct database hits. This can be particularly effective for data required for near real-time operations monitoring, reducing latency and improving response times.</li>
<li><strong>Data Archiving</strong>: Develop an archiving strategy to move older, less frequently accessed data out of the primary databases to free up resources and maintain performance. This archived data can be stored in a more cost-effective storage solution and still be accessible if needed for historical analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized Data Models</strong>: Review and optimize the data models used within the databases to ensure they are efficient for the queries and analyses performed. This might include denormalizing some data structures, adding appropriate indexes, or optimizing query designs.</li>
<li><strong>Database as a Service (DBaaS) Enhancements</strong>: Explore advanced features offered by Aurora Postgres and other DBaaS solutions, such as performance insights, automated scaling, and query optimization, to enhance database performance and management.</li>
<li><strong>Service Mesh for Microservices</strong>: Implement a service mesh to manage communication between microservices, providing enhanced control over data flow, security, and monitoring. This can help ensure that data processing microservices work together seamlessly and efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>API Gateway for Data Access</strong>: Introduce an API gateway as an intermediate layer between clients (like Tableau) and data sources. The API gateway can manage data requests, enforce access controls, and provide an additional abstraction layer, reducing direct database access.</li>
<li><strong>Data Validation and Quality Services</strong>: Develop microservices dedicated to continuous data validation and quality checks. This will ensure that data entering the system meets predefined quality standards, helping maintain data integrity across the system.</li>
<li><strong>Load Balancing and Auto-Scaling</strong>: Utilize load balancing and auto-scaling features to dynamically adjust resources based on demand, particularly for data processing microservices. This ensures that the system can handle peak loads efficiently without over-provisioning resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>By leveraging these strategies, the data engineer can significantly enhance the performance, scalability, and security of the existing data architecture without the immediate need for a data lake or data warehouse solution.
This can be done efficiently using the current Aurora Postgres instances and the flexibility offered by microservices architecture.
However, adopting a data lake or data warehouse architecture will always be a better solution, as it was for this specific use case.</p>

<p>N-Tier Architecture</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/data-architecture/n_tier_architecture.html#admonition-n-tier-architecture"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>N-tier architecture is an extension of the three-tier architecture that further separates concerns and functionalities into more discrete layers or tiers.
This approach enhances scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, making it suitable for complex, large-scale applications and data systems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the context of data systems, n-tier architecture might involve the following tiers, each focusing on specific aspects of the system:</p>
<p><strong>Presentation Tier</strong>:
This is the user interface layer where users interact with the system. It could include web clients, desktop applications, mobile apps, and dashboards.</p>
<p><strong>Business Logic Tier</strong>:
This layer handles the application's core functionality, including data processing logic, business rules, and task coordination. It acts as an intermediary between the presentation and data layers.</p>
<p><strong>Data Access Tier</strong>:
This tier is responsible for communicating with the data storage layer. It abstracts the underlying data operations (like CRUD operations) from the business logic layer, providing a more modular approach.</p>
<p><strong>Data Storage Tier</strong>:
This is where the data resides. It can include relational databases, NoSQL databases, file systems, or even external data sources. For more complex systems, this tier might comprise multiple databases or storage solutions, each optimized for specific types of data or access patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Cache Tier</strong>:
An optional but often crucial layer, the cache tier stores frequently accessed data in memory to speed up data retrieval and reduce the load on the data storage tier.</p>
<p><strong>Integration Tier</strong>:
An integration tier handles these interactions in systems that must communicate with external services, APIs, or legacy systems, ensuring the core system remains decoupled from external dependencies.</p>
<p><strong>Security Tier</strong>:
This dedicated layer manages authentication, authorization, and security policies, centralizing security mechanisms instead of scattering them across other tiers.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics and Reporting Tier</strong>:
Especially for data systems, an analytics tier might be included to handle data warehousing, big data processing, and business intelligence operations, separate from the operational data systems.</p>
<p><strong>Microservices/Service Layer</strong>:
Each microservice can be considered a tier in a microservices architecture, encapsulating a specific business capability and communicating with other services through well-defined interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Application/Service Orchestration Tier</strong>:
This layer manages the interactions and workflows between different services or components, especially in a microservices or distributed environment.</p>
<p>In an n-tier architecture, each tier can scale independently, be updated or maintained without significantly impacting other parts of the system, and even be distributed across different servers or environments to enhance performance and reliability.
This architecture provides high flexibility and modularity, allowing teams to adopt new technologies, scale parts of the system as needed, and improve resilience by isolating failures to specific tiers.</p>
<p>However, the complexity of managing an n-tier architecture should not be underestimated.
It requires careful planning, robust infrastructure, and effective communication mechanisms between tiers, often increasing development and maintenance costs.
Proper implementation of n-tier architectures can lead to highly scalable, flexible, and maintainable systems, making them suitable for complex enterprise-level applications and data systems.</p>
<p>Here are examples of n-tier architecture applied in scenarios where data engineering and analytics teams play a central role:</p>

<p>These examples demonstrate how n-tier architecture can be tailored to meet the specific needs of data-intensive applications, enabling data engineers and analytics teams to build scalable, flexible, and secure systems that support complex data processing and analytics workflows.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-2"><a class="header" href="#use-case-2">Use Case</a></h2>
<p>This use case continues to build on top of the use cases presented in the <a href="concepts/data-architecture/./two_tier_architecture.html#use-case">two-tier</a> and <a href="concepts/data-architecture/./three_tier_architecture.html#use-case">three-tier</a> architecture use cases.</p>
<p>Opetence Inc. updated its data infrastructure to enhance efficiency and scalability, centralizing around Apache Airflow for orchestrating data pipelines and dbt for data transformations.
This setup streamlined workflows and simplified data processing. Nightly ELT processes for microservices' databases were automated using Airbyte, reducing system load by scheduling tasks during off-peak hours.
A significant upgrade involved adopting Amazon S3 buckets for storing raw data in Parquet format, leveraging cloud storage's scalability and cost-effectiveness.
Redash was introduced to enable non-analytics teams to query transformed data marts, fostering a broader data-driven culture.
DataHub was implemented as the go-to metadata management system to manage the growing importance of metadata, enhancing data discoverability and trust.
For the near real-time operational data, a bespoke microservice created a Data Operational Store (DOS), directly feeding operational dashboards and platforms like Tableau through a secured API Gateway, ensuring streamlined and controlled data access.</p>
<p>This restructuration reflects the n-tier architecture as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Ingestion Tier</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Airbyte for nightly ELT processes from microservices' databases.</li>
<li>Fivetran for specific third-party integrations.</li>
<li>Custom solutions for Google Sheets data ingestion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Storage Tier</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Amazon S3 buckets for storing raw data in Parquet format.</li>
<li>Aurora Postgres instances for staging, transformed, and operational data.</li>
<li>Data Processing and Transformation Tier:</li>
<li>Apache Airflow for orchestrating data pipelines.</li>
<li>dbt for data transformation and preparing data marts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Access and API Management Tier</strong>:
<ul>
<li>API Gateway to provide secure and unified access to data for various consumers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Operational Store (DOS) Tier</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A specialized microservice creating a DOS for near real-time operational data needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Analytics and Reporting Tier</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Redash to enable broader access to data insights and reporting outside the analytics team.</li>
<li>Tableau and other dashboard platforms for operational teams, accessing DOS data through the API Gateway.</li>
<li>Tableau for Business Intelligence dashboards, accessing the marts through direct database access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Metadata Management Tier</strong>:
<ul>
<li>DataHub as the metadata management system to enhance data discoverability, governance, and trust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure illustrates the n-tier architecture's ability to decompose the data ecosystem into specialized, scalable tiers, each focused on a distinct aspect of data handling and analysis, ensuring efficiency and adaptability.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing the DOS for Near Real-Time Operational Data</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Gateway Integration</strong>: Tableau accesses near real-time operational data through an API Gateway, which acts as the intermediary between Tableau and the DOS. The API Gateway manages authentication, authorization, request routing, and potentially data transformation to ensure Tableau receives the necessary operational data in the required format.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Data Feeds</strong>: The DOS is optimized for speed and efficiency, providing Tableau with the latest operational data. This setup is crucial for dashboards that monitor real-time metrics or operational KPIs, where up-to-the-minute data is essential.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accessing the Analytics Database for Business Dashboards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Database Connection</strong>: Tableau connects directly to the Analytics Aurora Postgres database for business intelligence dashboards, where transformed and aggregated data marts are stored. This connection might use Tableau's built-in database connectors, allowing for efficient querying and data visualization.</li>
<li><strong>Data Transformation and Mart</strong>: The data within the Analytics database has been pre-processed and transformed (using dbt) to support business intelligence needs. This data is structured into marts that are optimized for analysis, enabling Tableau to generate comprehensive business dashboards.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this dual-access setup, Tableau leverages the strengths of both data stores—real-time operational insights from the DOS and in-depth analytical views from the Analytics database.
The API Gateway manages and secures access to the DOS, ensuring operational data is delivered swiftly and securely to support real-time decision-making.
Meanwhile, the direct connection to the Analytics database allows for deep insights into business performance metrics, trends, and strategic insights, supported by the rich, pre-processed data in the data marts.
This bifurcated approach ensures that users have the right data in the right context, whether for immediate operational needs or longer-term strategic analysis.</p>
<p>Please note that, even with all these updates, the company would benefit more, with probably a lower price, from implementing a proper data lake, data warehouse architecture, or a combination of both.
These and many more architectures will be discussed in detail later on.</p>

<h2 id="use-case-3"><a class="header" href="#use-case-3">Use Case</a></h2>
<p>At <a href="concepts/data-architecture/./n_tier_architecture.html#use-case">Opetence Inc.</a>, the data engineering team's growth and the business's evolving data needs led to the adoption of a microservices architecture to enhance their data handling capabilities, particularly focusing on managing and processing data stored in Amazon S3 in Parquet format.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>:</p>
<p>The company stores raw data from various sources, including operational microservices databases, third-party data (like Google Analytics and Facebook Ads), and Google Sheets, in an Amazon S3 bucket. However, this raw data comes in various formats and needs to be standardized, cleaned, and anonymized before it can be utilized effectively for analytics and operational reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Microservices for Data Preparation and Management</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now comprising two engineers, the data engineering team developed microservices to manage the S3 data lifecycle.</li>
<li>Each microservice is a containerized solution deployed to the AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), then AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), and then orchestrated using Apache Airflow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Functionalities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staging Area Processing</strong>: The microservice identifies data in non-Parquet formats and temporarily stores it in a dedicated staging area within the S3 bucket. It then transforms these files into Parquet format, leveraging Parquet's storage and query performance efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Data Cleaning and Anonymization</strong>: Once in Parquet format, the data undergoes cleaning to remove inconsistencies and errors. The microservice also masks and anonymizes the data to protect sensitive information, aligning with privacy regulations and company policies.</li>
<li><strong>Final Layer Preparation</strong>: After cleaning and anonymization, the microservice moves the prepared data to a "final layer" within the S3 bucket. This layer serves as the clean, reliable data source ready for ingestion into downstream systems like the Aurora Postgres instance.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Workflows</strong>: The microservice is integrated with Apache Airflow to automate and schedule these tasks, ensuring that the data in the S3 bucket is continuously monitored, processed, and maintained without manual intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Logging</strong>: The microservice includes comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities, tracking each step of the data processing workflow. This ensures transparency, facilitates debugging and helps optimize performance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Microservices Deployment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Containerization</strong>: By packaging the data processing application into containers, the team encapsulates the application and its dependencies into a standalone unit. This encapsulation is a hallmark of microservices, allowing each service to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.</li>
<li><strong>AWS ECR</strong>: Utilizing AWS ECR as the container registry for storing and managing container images aligns with cloud-native principles often associated with microservices architectures. ECR provides a secure, scalable, and efficient way to store and deploy container images, facilitating easy deployment and versioning of individual microservices.</li>
<li><strong>AWS ECS</strong>: ECS provides robust orchestration capabilities for containerized applications, managing the deployment, scaling, and management of container instances. When Airflow triggers microservices via ECS, it leverages ECS's capabilities to efficiently manage the container lifecycle, including starting, stopping, and scaling containers based on the defined tasks and workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Apache Airflow</strong>: Employing Apache Airflow to orchestrate the containerized tasks integrates well with the microservices approach by defining, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. Airflow can dynamically manage the containerized microservices, orchestrating complex data pipelines that involve multiple microservices working together to achieve the data processing goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this setup, each containerized task managed by Airflow can be considered a microservice, especially if these tasks are designed to perform specific, independent functions within the data processing pipeline.
This approach enhances the system's modularity, scalability, and resilience—key benefits of a microservices architecture.</p>
<p>By leveraging ECS as the runtime environment for microservices, Airflow can focus on orchestrating and scheduling the workflows while ECS handles the complexities of container management.
This separation of concerns leads to a more robust, scalable, and maintainable data processing infrastructure, aligning well with microservices architecture principles and cloud-native practices.</p>
<p><strong>Impact on Opetence Inc.</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Data Quality and Availability</strong>: The microservice ensures that only high-quality, anonymized data reaches the Aurora Postgres instance, supporting more accurate and reliable analytics and reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Efficiency</strong>: Automating the data preparation process reduces manual effort and accelerates data availability for business needs.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability and Flexibility</strong>: Adopting a microservices architecture allows the data engineering team to scale and update this service independently from other systems, providing agility to adapt to future data requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>This use case demonstrates how microservices architecture enables Opetence Inc. to manage its data lifecycle in S3 efficiently, from ingestion to transformation, ensuring data is ready for strategic use across the company.</p>

<div>
<p>🚧</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern where functionality is grouped around business processes and packaged as interoperable services.
These services can be reused and combined to achieve complex business functionalities.
In the context of data systems, SOA can be instrumental in creating a flexible, scalable, and modular infrastructure that can adapt to changing business needs.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of SOA in Data Systems</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loose Coupling</strong>: Services in SOA are designed to be loosely coupled, meaning they interact with each other through well-defined interfaces and contracts. This allows for greater flexibility in updating or replacing services without affecting the entire system.</li>
<li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: SOA emphasizes interoperability among different systems and services, often using standard protocols and data formats. This is particularly beneficial in data systems where integrating diverse data sources and applications is expected.</li>
<li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Services in an SOA are built to be reusable across different applications and business processes. For data systems, this means that data processing or data access services can be used by multiple applications, reducing redundancy and development effort.</li>
<li><strong>Standardized Service Contract</strong>: Services define their interactions through a formal contract, typically using WSDL (Web Services Description Language) for web services. This contract includes the service's operations, inputs, outputs, and other interaction details, ensuring clarity in service consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: SOA services hide the logic behind the service interface, providing an abstraction layer that separates the service implementation from its consumption. This is useful in data systems for abstracting complex data processing or integration logic behind simple service interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementing SOA in Data Systems</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Access Services</strong>: These services provide a standardized way to query and manipulate data across various data stores, ensuring consistent access patterns and data integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Data Transformation Services</strong>: Dedicated services for transforming data, such as format conversion, data enrichment, and validation, facilitating data integration and processing workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Data Integration Services</strong>: Services designed to integrate data from disparate sources, handling the complexities of data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) and ensuring that integrated data is accurate and up-to-date.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analytics Services</strong>: Offer analytical capabilities as reusable services, allowing applications to perform complex analytics without embedding analytical logic directly within them.</li>
<li><strong>Metadata Management Services</strong>: These services provide functionalities for managing metadata, enabling better data discovery, lineage tracking, and governance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Considerations</strong>:</p>
<p>While SOA offers many benefits for data systems, such as modularity, reusability, and interoperability, it also comes with challenges, including the complexity of managing service interactions and the potential for performance bottlenecks in heavily service-oriented environments.
Effective governance, robust service design, and careful management of service dependencies are crucial to realizing the benefits of SOA in data systems.</p>
<p>By adopting SOA principles, organizations can create a flexible and adaptable data architecture that efficiently meets evolving business requirements, leverage existing services, and integrate new technologies and data sources as needed.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) being applied within data systems:</p>

<h2 id="microservices-vs-service-oriented-architecture-soa"><a class="header" href="#microservices-vs-service-oriented-architecture-soa">Microservices vs. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</a></h2>
<p>The differences between the microservices paradigm and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) can sometimes be subtle, as both architectures are designed around the use of services.
However, they differ in scope, granularity, approach to decoupling and integration, and typical use cases.
Here's a comparison:</p>
<p><strong>Scope and Granularity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microservices</strong>: Focus on building small, single-purpose services that do one thing well. Each microservice corresponds closely to a specific business function or capability. This results in a larger number of more granular services.</li>
<li><strong>SOA</strong>: Typically involves larger, more comprehensive services that may encompass multiple business functions or capabilities within a single service. SOA services are often less granular and more encompassing than microservices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decoupling and Integration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microservices</strong>: Microservices highly emphasize decoupling, both in terms of service development and data management. To ensure complete independence, microservices often have their own dedicated databases. Integration is commonly achieved through APIs or event-driven mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>SOA</strong>: While SOA also promotes decoupling, it tends to have a more centralized approach to data management, with services more likely to share databases or data stores. Integration in SOA is typically done through enterprise service buses (ESBs) or other middleware solutions, facilitating communication and orchestration among services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communication</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microservices</strong>: Communication between microservices is typically lightweight, using protocols like REST or messaging queues to facilitate asynchronous communication and avoid tight coupling.</li>
<li><strong>SOA</strong>: SOA often relies on more heavyweight, standardized protocols such as SOAP and might use complex messaging patterns facilitated by an ESB for service orchestration and choreography.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deployment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microservices</strong>: Designed for independent deployment, allowing for continuous delivery and deployment practices. This enables teams to update individual microservices without impacting others.</li>
<li><strong>SOA</strong>: Services in an SOA might be more tightly integrated and co-deployed, making independent deployments more challenging. SOA's emphasis on reusability can sometimes lead to more inter-service dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use Cases</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microservices</strong>: Well-suited for cloud-native applications, particularly those requiring agility, scalability, and a high pace of innovation. Each microservice can be developed, scaled, and deployed independently.</li>
<li><strong>SOA</strong>: Often used in enterprise environments where integrating a wide range of different applications and systems is a priority. SOA can provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring these integrations are robust and manageable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Organizational Impact</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Microservices</strong>: Encourage small, cross-functional teams that own the entire lifecycle of a service, aligning closely with DevOps and Agile methodologies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SOA</strong>: May involve more centralized governance and potentially larger development teams, focusing on maximizing service reuse across the organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>While microservices and SOA share the concept of service-based architectures, they apply these concepts differently, reflecting their distinct origins and goals.
Microservices aim for fine-grained services and independence at all levels, whereas SOA aims to ensure broad interoperability and integration across diverse systems and applications.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-4"><a class="header" href="#use-case-4">Use Case</a></h2>
<p>Given Opetence Inc.'s<sup><a name="to-footnote-1"><a href="concepts/data-architecture/soa.html#footnote-1">1</a></a></sup> characteristics as a recently founded startup with small teams, extensive use of cloud services, and enforcing microservices architecture for backend development, a microservices approach would naturally extend to the data team. However, there could still be scenarios where adopting Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) elements within the data team could be beneficial, particularly in areas where broad integration, comprehensive service capabilities, or extensive reuse across multiple business domains is required. Here are a few potential use cases:</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Data Integration</strong>:</p>
<p>As Opetence Inc. grows and integrates with more external partners, vendors, or third-party services, SOA principles can facilitate this integration. SOA's emphasis on standardized interfaces and protocols can simplify connecting disparate systems, ensuring consistent and reliable data exchange.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy System Modernization</strong>:</p>
<p>If Opetence Inc. acquires legacy systems through mergers or as part of its growth strategy, SOA can serve as a bridge during the modernization process.
SOA can wrap legacy systems in standardized service interfaces, allowing the data team to access and integrate legacy data with newer cloud-based microservices until full modernization can be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Centralized Data Services</strong>:</p>
<p>SOA can provide a centralized approach in scenarios where multiple microservices or applications need common data services (like authentication, authorization, logging, or monitoring)—implementing these as SOA services can promote reuse and consistency across the organization's data infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Complex Business Processes</strong>:</p>
<p>SOA can offer robust solutions for complex business processes requiring the orchestration of multiple data services and workflows.
Utilizing an <a href="concepts/data-architecture/./esb.html">enterprise service bus (ESB)</a> or similar middleware within an SOA framework can manage these complex interactions more effectively than a purely microservices-based approach.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Compliance and Data Governance</strong>:</p>
<p>In industries subject to strict regulatory requirements, SOA's emphasis on well-defined contracts and interfaces can support compliance efforts, particularly regarding data privacy and security.
A more centralized approach to managing data services can also facilitate comprehensive data governance practices.</p>
<p><strong>Data Analytics and Business Intelligence</strong>:</p>
<p>As Opetence Inc.'s data analytics and business intelligence needs become more complex, SOA can support the integration of diverse data sources into a cohesive analytics platform.
SOA services can act as intermediaries, transforming and consolidating data from various microservices into formats suitable for advanced analytics and reporting.</p>
<p>In these scenarios, the key is not to adopt SOA in its entirety but to selectively incorporate SOA principles where they add value, complementing the microservices architecture.
This hybrid approach allows Opetence Inc. to leverage the strengths of both architectures—using microservices for agility and scalability and SOA for integration, standardization, and complex orchestration.<p><hr/></p>

Their plan, advised by an AWS expert, aimed to enhance and expand their current setup to support growing data warehousing, data marts, reports, and dashboard needs.</p>
<p>The team's strategy involved leveraging AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for nightly comprehensive migrations from all operational databases into an S3 bucket.
This approach ensured a reliable nightly operational data snapshot, ready for further processing.
In S3, dedicated data cleaning and anonymization routines were to be established, safeguarding data quality and adhering to privacy standards.</p>
<p>The team planned to utilize AWS Lake Formation to centralize and manage this refined data, creating a robust data lake that serves as a single source of truth for the company's data.
They intended to enhance the Staging Aurora Postgres instance for more dynamic data ingestion, including real-time streams and API data, enabling a seamless flow of diverse data types into their ecosystem.</p>
<p>A significant upgrade was planned for their analytics backbone, Amazon Redshift, to serve as the core of their scalable data warehousing solution.
Redshift would access the Lake Formation data and the structured data in Aurora Postgres through external schemas facilitated by Redshift Spectrum, providing a comprehensive view across all data assets.</p>
<p>To ensure efficiency in data transformations and maintain best practices, the data team decided to containerize their dbt models and deploy them on AWS ECS.

<p>🚧</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Data Mesh is an architectural and organizational paradigm that treats data as a product, emphasizing domain-oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture.
It's particularly suitable for large organizations with complex and distributed data landscapes.
In a Data Mesh framework, data is managed and owned by domain-specific teams who treat their data as products, making it discoverable, addressable, and securely accessible to other teams within the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamental Concepts of Data Mesh</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership</strong>: Data is owned and managed by domain-specific teams responsible for the full lifecycle of their data products, from creation to serving to end-users.</li>
<li><strong>Data as a Product</strong>: Data assets are treated as products, with a focus on user needs, usability, and quality. Each data product should have clear ownership, documentation, SLAs, and versioning.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Serve Data Infrastructure</strong>: To enable domain teams to manage their data products effectively, a self-serve data platform is provided. This platform offers tools and services that abstract away the complexity of underlying data technologies, enabling teams to easily ingest, store, manage, and serve their data.</li>
<li><strong>Federated Computational Governance</strong>: Governance policies and standards are applied across the organization, but the domain teams handle implementation details. This approach allows for global consistency in areas like security and compliance while enabling localized flexibility and innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing a Data Mesh architecture can vary significantly depending on the size and complexity of the organization.
Here are examples tailored to small, medium, and large companies:</p>
<div id="admonition-small-companies" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Small Companies</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/data-architecture/data_mesh.html#admonition-small-companies"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In a small company, resources are often limited, and the focus is on agility and rapid growth.
A Data Mesh might look like a lightweight, informal version of the full paradigm.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Identification</strong>: With fewer and less complex domains, a small company might only have a handful of domains, such as Sales, Marketing, and Product. Each domain could be managed by a small team or even a single individual.</li>
<li><strong>Data Product Ownership</strong>: Given the size, individuals or small teams could take on multiple roles, including data product ownership, combining this responsibility with their regular duties.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Serve Data Infrastructure</strong>: The infrastructure might rely heavily on managed services to reduce overhead, using tools like Google BigQuery, AWS RDS, or MongoDB Atlas for data storage and processing, with simple, user-friendly tools for data integration and analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Governance and Collaboration</strong>: Governance might be more informal, with a focus on practical, lightweight guidelines that encourage data sharing and reuse. Regular team meetings and shared tools could facilitate cross-domain collaboration.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Medium-sized Companies</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/data-architecture/data_mesh.html#admonition-medium-sized-companies"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As companies grow, the data landscape becomes more complex, but they may not yet have the resources for a fully-fledged Data Mesh.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Identification</strong>: Domains become more defined, with clear boundaries and dedicated teams for areas like Customer Support, Operations, Finance, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Data Product Ownership</strong>: Specific roles for data product owners might be established, with individuals or small teams dedicated to managing the data lifecycle within their domain.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Serve Data Infrastructure</strong>: The data platform might be more sophisticated, potentially involving custom development to meet specific needs and the use of managed services for scalability. Tools like Apache Airflow for orchestration and dbt for transformations might be employed.</li>
<li><strong>Governance and Collaboration</strong>: Formal governance structures start to take shape, with clear policies for data quality, security, and privacy. A central data team that facilitates sharing, standards, and best practices might support cross-domain collaboration.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="admonition-large-companies" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Large Companies</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/data-architecture/data_mesh.html#admonition-large-companies"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>With their complex and distributed data ecosystems, large organizations can fully embrace the Data Mesh paradigm, though it requires significant investment in culture, processes, and technology.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Identification</strong>: Numerous domains exist across various business units, each with its complexities. Domains are well-defined, with dedicated teams and significant autonomy.</li>
<li><strong>Data Product Ownership</strong>: Data product owners are well-established roles with clear responsibilities for the end-to-end management of their data products. These owners work closely with domain experts to ensure data meets the needs of its consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Serve Data Infrastructure</strong>: A robust, scalable self-serve platform is crucial, possibly involving a mix of custom-built and managed services. This platform would offer advanced capabilities for data ingestion, processing, governance, and serving, tailored to the diverse needs of domain teams.</li>
<li><strong>Governance and Collaboration</strong>: A federated governance model is in place, with central oversight ensuring compliance with regulatory and organizational standards while allowing flexibility in implementation. Tools like data catalogs and marketplaces facilitate discovery and collaboration across domains.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>In each of these examples, the implementation of Data Mesh principles needs to be adapted to the organization's scale, maturity, and specific challenges, ensuring that the architecture remains practical and aligned with business objectives.</p>

<p>The data team identified the following risks and mitigation strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complexity and Overhead</strong>: Given the small size of the data team, there's a risk of becoming overwhelmed. The plan must prioritize automation and managed services to reduce overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Data Governance and Security</strong>: With multiple domains accessing and manipulating data, ensuring data security and compliance becomes challenging. The plan must contemplate the implementation of fine-grained access controls and audit logs to monitor data access and modifications.</li>
<li><strong>Vendor Lock-in</strong>: Relying heavily on a single cloud provider can lead to vendor lock-in. The plan should consider using open standards and formats for data storage and processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>After consulting with the CTO and product teams, it became evident that product owners are keen on acquiring basic skills in Tableau and SQL to investigate data and run simple queries. However, due to certain constraints, such as a lack of AWS users, analysts and product owners do not have direct access to Redshift, and they require Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities to use corporate emails for login. The selected solution was to utilize the existing Redash and Tableau infrastructure, as both support SSO integration, enabling users to log in smoothly with their corporate email accounts. This solution offers an intuitive interface without requiring direct access to the underlying data warehouse. Additionally, the data team could design a training program customized to the product owners' and analysts' skill levels to support this initiative, with a focus on basic SQL and Tableau usage. This program could comprise hands-on workshops, curated learning resources, and regular Q&amp;A sessions to build confidence and proficiency in data exploration and visualization.</p>
<p>Redash is an easy-to-use platform perfect for product owners and analysts who want to run queries and analyze data.
The interface is SQL-friendly, which makes it particularly useful for those with basic SQL knowledge.
Redash's dashboards are simple to understand and provide an easy way to visualize query results, making it an ideal tool for exploring data.</p>
<p>Tableau, on the other hand, offers more advanced visualization and dashboarding functions.
Its drag-and-drop interface and wide range of visualization options make it suitable for creating complex reports and dashboards.
To enable access to Redshift without direct AWS credentials, the data team can configure Tableau to connect to Redshift through a service account they manage.
This ensures secure access to data without exposing sensitive credentials.</p>
<p>The data team has emphasized to the CTO the importance of incorporating version control while creating dashboards and reports.
They have pointed out the potential risks associated with the lack of such a system.
To mitigate these risks, it was decided that the code for critical dashboards and reports would be version-controlled, using GitHub, and managed by the data team.
This approach ensures traceability, promotes collaboration and allows for the rollback of changes if necessary.</p>
<p>Product teams must submit tickets to the analytics team for modifying or creating dashboards.
This delineates a clear process for changes while absolving the data team accountable for any unversioned dashboard alterations.
While product teams retain the autonomy to craft and modify their dashboards and reports, they are not allowed to alter official ones, thereby preserving the integrity of critical data visualizations.</p>
<p>Redash's process involves submitting tickets to create views and tables within official schemas.
Meanwhile, product teams can only create such assets within their respective sandbox environments.
This approach ensures a structured yet flexible way of managing data across the organization.</p>

This layer is engineered for high scalability, supporting both real-time streaming and batch ingestion processes to ensure that data is captured and stored efficiently and reliably.
The primary aim is to preserve the data's original state, with added metadata for improved traceability and manageability, facilitating reprocessing or analysis in its true form as necessary.</p>
<h2 id="distillation-layer-silver-or-refined"><a class="header" href="#distillation-layer-silver-or-refined">Distillation Layer (Silver or Refined)</a></h2>
<p>In the transition from the Ingestion to the Silver layer, also known as the Refined layer, raw data undergoes essential transformations to structure and organize it into a format more conducive to analysis.
This refining stage is crucial for cleansing, deduplicating, conforming, and enriching the data, ensuring consistency and reliability across the enterprise.
The modifications at this level are intentionally minimal yet precise, designed to prepare the data for more advanced analytics without incorporating complex business logic or extensive transformations reserved for the subsequent Processing (Gold) Layer.
This approach maintains a balance between making the data analytically accessible while preserving the granularity necessary for detailed examination.</p>
<h2 id="processing-layer-gold-or-cured"><a class="header" href="#processing-layer-gold-or-cured">Processing Layer (Gold or Cured)</a></h2>
<p>In the Gold Layer, also recognized as the Curated or Business layer, data undergoes its final transformations to emerge as fully prepared, enriched datasets tailored for specific business use cases and analytical endeavors.
This layer is distinguished by its highly curated, performance-optimized datasets readily accessible for BI reporting, advanced analytics, and machine learning applications.
Data models here are meticulously designed for consumption, often embodying business domains in denormalized structures, such as star schemas or subject-oriented data marts. They are enriched with dimensional models, aggregates, and KPIs to directly address the needs of business users and decision-makers.
The Gold layer ensures that data is not only reliable and understandable but also structured in a way that makes it immediately applicable to solving business challenges.</p>
<h2 id="insights-layer"><a class="header" href="#insights-layer">Insights Layer</a></h2>
<p>The Insights Layer is the interface for user interaction with the Data Lake.
It transforms data into actionable insights through dashboards, reports, and visual analytics.
It brings data to life, empowering users with the information needed for informed decision-making and guiding strategic actions within the organization.</p>
<h2 id="unified-operations-layer"><a class="header" href="#unified-operations-layer">Unified Operations Layer</a></h2>
<p>The backbone of any robust Data Lake architecture is its operations layer.
It integrates data governance, compliance, security, and performance optimization, ensuring the Data Lake's reliability and integrity as a critical organizational asset.</p>
<p>Together, these layers form a comprehensive framework for managing data in a Data Lake environment, supporting a wide range of analytical and operational use cases while ensuring data remains secure, high-quality, and accessible.</p>
<h2 id="the-medallion-architecture"><a class="header" href="#the-medallion-architecture">The Medallion Architecture</a></h2>
<p>The medallion or multi-hop architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns between data storage, processing, and consumption, providing several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: By separating data processing into distinct stages, the architecture provides flexibility in applying different transformations and data quality rules at each stage, allowing for iterative improvements and optimizations.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Each layer can scale independently based on the processing and storage needs, accommodating varying data volumes and complexity of transformations.</li>
<li><strong>Governance and Quality Control</strong>: With clear demarcations between raw, refined, and curated data, appropriate governance policies, data quality checks, and security measures can be applied more easily at each stage, improving the overall reliability and trustworthiness of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: By the time data reaches the Gold layer, it's in a form that's readily accessible and usable by business analysts, data scientists, and decision-makers, speeding up the time-to-insight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the medallion or multi-hop architecture is a comprehensive approach to managing data in a Data Lake, ensuring that data flows smoothly from ingestion to consumption while maintaining quality, governance, and accessibility.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Freshness</strong>:
While also dealing with current data, DOS in this context might not necessarily integrate data from multiple sources. Each DOS might be dedicated to a specific application or operational system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Integration and Cleansing</strong>:
A DOS might not always include data cleansing and integration functionalities. It may store data as it is generated or captured by operational systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>:
Used by applications and operational systems for immediate transaction processing, such as order processing systems, inventory management systems, and other OLTP systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-differences"><a class="header" href="#key-differences">Key Differences</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration</strong>:
ODS typically integrates data from multiple sources and provides a unified view, whereas DOS might refer to individual operational systems or databases optimized for specific applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Processing</strong>:
ODS may include more sophisticated data processing capabilities, such as data cleansing and transformation, to ensure data quality and consistency. DOS, in the broader sense, may focus on efficiently handling transactions and queries for specific operational processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Case</strong>:
ODS is more closely aligned with operational reporting and analytics, providing a comprehensive view of business operations for decision-making. DOS, when referred to as individual operational databases, supports the immediate transactional needs of specific applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, the distinction between ODS and DOS can be subtle and depends on the organizational context and specific architecture. Some organizations might use the term DOS to describe what is traditionally known as an ODS, especially when emphasizing the operational aspect of the data store.</p>
<h2 id="operational-data-stores-ods"><a class="header" href="#operational-data-stores-ods">Operational Data Stores (ODS)</a></h2>

<p>In the landscape of modern data architecture, ODS plays a vital role in bridging the gap between raw operational data and analytical insights. By providing timely, integrated, and cleansed data, an ODS enhances operational efficiency and decision-making, complementing the deeper, historical insights derived from data lakes and warehouses.</p>
<h2 id="data-operational-stores-dos"><a class="header" href="#data-operational-stores-dos">Data Operational Stores (DOS)</a></h2>
<p>Data operational stores (DOS) are specialized databases designed to support operational applications with real-time, transactional data requirements. Unlike analytical data stores, such as data warehouses and data lakes that are optimized for large-scale querying and analysis, DOS is optimized for high-performance, transactional workloads where speed and efficiency of read/write operations are critical.</p>
<h3 id="dos-goals"><a class="header" href="#dos-goals">DOS Goals</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-Time Operations</strong>:
DOS are used in scenarios where applications need immediate access to current, transactional data, such as e-commerce platforms, online banking systems, and other customer-facing applications.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dos-uses-in-modern-data-architecture"><a class="header" href="#dos-uses-in-modern-data-architecture">DOS Uses in Modern Data Architecture</a></h3>
<p>In modern data architectures, DOSs coexist with data lakes and data warehouses as part of a broader data ecosystem. While data lakes and data warehouses are used for storing and analyzing large volumes of historical data, DOSs are used for operational applications that need real-time access to current data. The interaction between these components might look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Ingestion</strong>:
Data generated by operational activities in the DOS can be ingested into data lakes and data warehouses for long-term storage, historical analysis, and reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Enrichment</strong>:
Data from data lakes or warehouses can be used to enrich the operational data in the DOS, providing additional context or insights to support operational decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid Processing</strong>:
Some modern architectures use hybrid processing models where transactional and analytical workloads coexist, leveraging technologies like HTAP (Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing) systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples-of-data-operational-stores"><a class="header" href="#examples-of-data-operational-stores">Examples of Data Operational Stores</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Relational Databases</strong>:
Traditional relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database often serve as operational stores, offering ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties essential for transactional data integrity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NoSQL Databases</strong>:
NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase are used for operational stores, especially when dealing with unstructured data, needs for horizontal scalability, or specific data models like key-value, document, or columnar stores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NewSQL Databases</strong>:
Systems like Google Spanner and CockroachDB combine the scalability of NoSQL systems with the ACID guarantees of traditional relational databases, making them suitable for distributed operational stores.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, data operational stores are a critical component of modern data architecture, particularly for applications requiring real-time data access and high transactional throughput. They complement data lakes and data warehouses by providing a layer optimized for operational activities while enabling seamless data flow and integration across the data ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="dos-vs-microservices-databases-backend"><a class="header" href="#dos-vs-microservices-databases-backend">DOS vs. Microservices Databases (Backend)</a></h3>
<p>Databases used by microservices in a backend architecture can be seen as a specialized form of Data Operational Stores (DOS), tailored to the specific requirements of a microservices architecture. These databases share the operational focus of traditional DOS, aimed at supporting real-time or near-real-time data access and transaction processing. However, there are notable distinctions rooted in the architectural principles and data management strategies of microservices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Autonomy</strong>:
Microservices architectures advocate for a database-per-service model, where each microservice's database is dedicated solely to that service's functionality. This encapsulation ensures service autonomy, a principle that diverges from traditional DOS, which might aggregate and integrate data from various operational systems to provide a unified view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Isolation</strong>:
In line with microservices principles, these databases prioritize data isolation, limiting the scope of data to the boundaries of each service. This approach contrasts with DOS's objective of integrating data from multiple sources for comprehensive operational reporting and analytics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration and Duplication</strong>:
Data integration in a microservices ecosystem is commonly handled through APIs, events, or messaging systems, respecting the decoupled nature of services. This method differs from DOS, where data integration occurs at the storage level. Moreover, microservices architectures may intentionally duplicate data across services to maintain decoupling, a practice generally minimized in DOS to ensure data consistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operational Reporting</strong>:
While traditional DOS is often used for operational reporting and analysis across integrated data sets, microservices databases are typically not designed for this purpose. Their role is more focused on supporting the specific operational needs of individual services rather than providing a cross-functional operational data view.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The operational databases within a microservices architecture can be viewed as a variant of DOS, with a narrower scope aligned with the microservice they support. The key distinction lies in the microservices' emphasis on service autonomy, data encapsulation, and decentralized data management, which contrasts with the broader, integrative purpose of traditional DOS in providing a unified operational data view. This nuanced understanding bridges the conceptual gap between microservices databases and DOS, highlighting their shared operational focus while acknowledging their architectural and functional differences.</p>
<p>In modern architectures, both play crucial roles, with microservices' databases ensuring service independence and a DOS enhancing organizational-wide data accessibility and decision-making.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="slowly-changing-dimensions-scd"><a class="header" href="#slowly-changing-dimensions-scd">Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)</a></h1>
<p>Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) are concepts in data warehousing used to manage and track changes in dimension data over time. Dimensions in data warehousing refer to descriptive attributes related to business entities, such as products, customers, or geographical locations, which can change over time. Managing these changes accurately is crucial for historical reporting, trend analysis, and decision-making.</p>
<h2 id="type-0-fixed-dimension"><a class="header" href="#type-0-fixed-dimension">Type 0: Fixed Dimension</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>No changes are allowed. The dimension data is static, and any updates to the source data are ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suitable for data that doesn't change, such as historical data, fixed identifiers, or regulatory codes.</p>
<h2 id="type-1-overwrite"><a class="header" href="#type-1-overwrite">Type 1: Overwrite</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Updates overwrite existing records, with no history of previous values being kept. This approach is simple but sacrifices historical accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appropriate when historical data isn't necessary for analysis, or for correcting minor errors in dimension attributes.</p>
<h2 id="type-2-add-new-row"><a class="header" href="#type-2-add-new-row">Type 2: Add New Row</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This approach involves adding a new row with the updated values while retaining the old rows to preserve history. Typically, attributes like "valid from," "valid to," and "current indicator" are used to manage the versioning of records.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essential for detailed historical tracking where it's important to know the state of the dimension at any point in time, such as tracking address changes for a customer.</p>
<h2 id="type-3-add-new-attribute"><a class="header" href="#type-3-add-new-attribute">Type 3: Add New Attribute</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Involves adding new attributes to store the current and previous values of the changed dimension. It's limited in historical tracking as it usually only keeps the last change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Useful when only the most recent historical data is needed, such as tracking the previous and current manager of an employee.</p>
<h2 id="type-4-history-table"><a class="header" href="#type-4-history-table">Type 4: History Table</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Separates the current data from historical data by maintaining a current table (similar to Type 1) and a separate history table (similar to Type 2) to track changes over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beneficial for performance optimization, as it keeps the main dimension table smaller and more efficient for queries, while still allowing historical analysis.</p>
<h2 id="hybrid-combination-of-types"><a class="header" href="#hybrid-combination-of-types">Hybrid: Combination of Types</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Combines features from different types to suit specific needs. A common hybrid approach is using Type 2 with a current indicator flag or combining Type 2 for historical tracking with Type 1 attributes for frequently changing attributes where history isn't needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good fit for complex scenarios where different attributes of the dimension require different types of change management. For example, storing a complete history of address changes (Type 2) while only keeping the current phone number (Type 1).</p>
<h2 id="considerations"><a class="header" href="#considerations">Considerations</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Volume</strong>:
SCD Type 2 and Type 4 can significantly increase data volume due to the historical records they generate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Query Complexity</strong>:
SCD Type 2 and hybrids can introduce complexity into queries, as they require filtering for current or specific historical records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>:
Type 1 and Type 0 are generally more performant for queries due to the lack of versioning but at the cost of historical accuracy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, the choice of SCD type depends on the specific business requirements, the importance of historical accuracy, query performance needs, and the complexity that the organization can manage. It's not uncommon for a single data warehouse to employ multiple SCD types across different dimensions based on these considerations.</p>

<p>Systems reliability is determined by its adherence to a clear, complete, consistent, and unambiguous behavior specification.
A reliable system performs predictably without errors or failures and consistently delivers its intended service.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This chapter aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the concepts of Reliability and Safety as presented by Alan Burns and Andy Wellings in their book<sup><a name="to-footnote-1"><a href="concepts/systems_reliability.html#footnote-1">1</a></a></sup> "Real-Time Systems and Programming Languages."
These concepts, and many others, have been developed by different industries over several decades and consolidated in the sub-discipline of systems engineering known today as <strong>Reliability Engineering</strong>.</p>
<p>I will supplement these concepts by looking at reliability in other engineering fields, such as mechanical and industrial engineering, drawing comparisons and analogies to help you better understand the core concepts.</p>
<p>Lastly, I will contextualize these concepts with the current reliability concepts being worked on in the software, data, and computer systems industry.
I will explore many tools and frameworks data teams can use to design and manage reliable data systems.</p>

<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/impediments.html#admonition-classifying-system-impediments"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Failures</strong> result from unexpected internal problems that a system eventually exhibits in its external behavior.
These problems are called <strong>errors</strong>, and their mechanical or algorithmic causes are called <strong>defects</strong> or <strong>faults</strong>.</p>
<p>When a system's behavior deviates from its specifications, it is said to have a <strong>failure</strong>, or the system has <strong>failed</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Systems are composed of <strong>components</strong>, each of which can be considered a system.
Thus, a failure in one system can induce a fault in another, which may result in an error and a potential failure of this system.
This failure can continue and affect any related system, and so on.
A faulty system component will produce an error under specific circumstances during the system's lifetime.</p>

<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Hint</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/impediments.html#admonition-hint"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A system is the sum of external and internal states</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>An external state not specified in the system's behavior will be considered a failure.
The system consists of many components (each with its many states), all contributing to its external behavior.
The combination of these components' states is called the system's internal state. <em>An unspecified internal state is considered an error, and the component that produced the illegal state transition is said to be faulty</em>.</p>

<p>Defining Failure Modes</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/impediments.html#admonition-defining-failure-modes"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A system can fail in many ways.
A designer may design the system assuming a finite number of failure modes, but the system may fail unexpectedly.</p>
<p>The failure mode is the specific way in which a part, component, function, equipment, subsystem, or system fails.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Three types of failure modes can occur with a service: <strong>value failures</strong>, <strong>timing failures</strong>, and <strong>arbitrary failures</strong>.
Value failures, also known as value domain failures, happen when the value associated with a service is incorrect.
Timing failures, or time domain failures, occur when a service is completed at the wrong time.
Arbitrary failures are a combination of value and timing failures.</p>
<h3 id="value-domain-failures"><a class="header" href="#value-domain-failures">Value Domain Failures</a></h3>
<p>Value domain failures can be classified into <strong>boundary errors</strong> and <strong>wrong values</strong>.
Boundary errors occur when the value is outside the expected range, including typing errors.
They are commonly referred to as <strong>constraint errors</strong>.
On the other hand, wrong values occur when the value is within the correct range but still incorrect.</p>
<div id="admonition-constraint-errors-examples" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Constraint Errors Examples</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/impediments.html#admonition-constraint-errors-examples"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An Apache Airflow DAG aggregating daily sales data failed due to an exceeding total sales amount, leading to a constraint error while inserting data into the database.
This issue may have arisen because of an unexpected sales surge or an aggregation logic error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ELT process may encounter a boundary error when migrating data from a source database field defined as VARCHAR(255) to a target database field defined as VARCHAR(50) if a record contains more than 50 characters.
This could result in insertion failure and data loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dbt model calculates a new metric that results in negative inventory levels for certain products due to an error in the calculation logic.
The database schema enforces a constraint that inventory levels must be zero or positive, leading to a boundary error when the model tries to update the inventory table with negative values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An Airflow task that updates a customer's loyalty points based on recent purchases mistakenly doubles the points due to a bug in the calculation logic.
Although the updated loyalty points value remains within the acceptable range, it is incorrect, constituting a wrong value error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dbt model designed to compute monthly revenue projections mistakenly uses an outdated exchange rate for currency conversion.
While within the expected range, the resulting revenue figures are inaccurate due to the wrong exchange rate, leading to a wrong value error.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>In each of these examples, the integrity and reliability of the data are compromised, either by violating predefined constraints (boundary errors) or by producing incorrect but plausible values (wrong value errors).
Addressing these errors requires thorough validation, testing, and monitoring of data pipelines to ensure data accuracy and integrity.</p>
<h3 id="time-domain-failures"><a class="header" href="#time-domain-failures">Time Domain Failures</a></h3>
<p>Failures in the time domain can cause the service to be delivered <strong>too early</strong>, <strong>too late</strong>, <strong>infinitely late</strong>, or <strong>unexpected</strong>.</p>

<p>These examples highlight how timing issues in data processing workflows can lead to various types of service failures, emphasizing the importance of precise scheduling, error handling, and system monitoring to ensure timely and reliable data services.</p>
<h3 id="failure-modes-types"><a class="header" href="#failure-modes-types">Failure Modes Types</a></h3>
<p>In general, we can assume the modes in which a system can fail:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Uncontrolled failure</strong>:
A system that produces arbitrary errors in value and time domains (including improvisation errors).</p>
<div id="admonition-uncontrolled-failure-example" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Uncontrolled Failure Example</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/impediments.html#admonition-uncontrolled-failure-example"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>An Airflow DAG responsible for data aggregation experiences a memory leak in one of its tasks, leading to erratic behavior.
This results in some data records being processed multiple times (value domain error), some being skipped entirely (omission error), and others being processed at unpredictable intervals (time domain error).
The failures are arbitrary, impacting both the correctness of the data (value domain) and its timeliness (time domain).</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delay failure</strong>:
A system that produces correct services in the value domain but suffers from timing delays.</p>
<div id="admonition-delay-failure-example" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">

<p>A dbt model that calculates end-of-month financial summaries experiences significant delays due to resource contention in the data warehouse.
While the financial summaries are eventually calculated correctly (value domain is unaffected), they are not available in time for the monthly financial meeting (time domain error), constituting a delayed failure.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Silent failure</strong>:
A system that produces correct services in value and time domains until it fails.
The only possible failure is omission, and when it occurs, all subsequent services will also suffer from omission failures.</p>
<div id="admonition-silent-failure-example" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Silent Failure Example</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/impediments.html#admonition-silent-failure-example"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>An ELT task silently fails to replicate a subset of records from a source database to a data lake due to a transient network issue.
The task does not report any errors; subsequent data loads continue as if nothing happened. However, the missing records lead to incomplete datasets in the data lake, representing omission failures that are not immediately apparent.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crash failure</strong>:
A system that presents all the properties of a silent failure but allows other systems to detect it has entered the state of silent failure.</p>
<div id="admonition-crash-failure-example" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Crash Failure Example</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/impediments.html#admonition-crash-failure-example"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Airflow scheduler, responsible for triggering and managing data pipeline tasks, crashes due to an overload of scheduled jobs exceeding the system's available resources.
The crash causes all data processing jobs managed by Airflow to halt, leading to a temporary cessation of data operations.
However, the built-in health check mechanisms of the Airflow system detect the scheduler's unavailability and automatically initiate a restart procedure.
The rapid detection and response to the crash ensure that the data pipelines are restored with minimal manual intervention, showcasing another instance of a crash failure where the system's failure state is quickly identified and mitigated.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Controlled failure</strong>:
A system that fails in a specified and controlled manner.</p>
<div id="admonition-crash-failure-example-1" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Crash Failure Example</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/impediments.html#admonition-crash-failure-example-1"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A dbt model performing data validation detects that incoming data exceeds predefined quality thresholds (e.g., too many null values in a critical column).
The model deliberately enters a controlled failure state, rejecting the batch of data and triggering a predefined alert to the data quality team for review without processing the faulty data further.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A system consistently producing the correct services is classified as failure-free.</p>
<h3 id="impediments-use-case"><a class="header" href="#impediments-use-case">Impediments Use Case</a></h3>
<p>Let's consider an example involving a data pipeline that aggregates daily sales data for a retail company:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario</strong>:
A data pipeline is designed to aggregate sales data from various stores at the end of each day and update a dashboard that the management team uses for decision-making.
The pipeline includes several steps: extracting data from store databases, transforming the data to align with the aggregation schema, and loading the data into a data warehouse where the aggregation occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong>:
One day, the management team noticed that the <em>sales dashboard had not been updated with the previous day's data</em>, even though the day had ended and the data should have been available.</p>
<p><strong>Error</strong>:
Investigation reveals that the data transformation step in the pipeline failed due to an <em>unexpected data format in one of the store's sales records</em>.
This malformed record caused the transformation script to terminate unexpectedly, preventing the aggregated data from being loaded into the data warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>Defect</strong>:
The root cause (defect) is identified as a <em>lack of proper data validation and error handling</em> within the transformation script. The script was not designed to handle records with this particular formatting anomaly, leading to its premature termination.</p>
<p><strong>Failure Domain</strong>:
This is a failure in the <em>time domain</em>, as the expected service (daily sales data aggregation) was not delivered on time.</p>
<p><strong>Failure Mode Classification</strong>:
The failure mode can be classified as <em>infinitely late</em> (omission failure) since the service (updating the dashboard with aggregated sales data) was never delivered for the affected day.</p>
<p><strong>Failure Mode Type</strong>:
Given that the system did not alert the failure (the dashboard wasn't updated, with no error messages or alerts), this can be classified as a <em>silent failure</em>. The system failed to perform its intended function without providing any notification of the problem.</p>
<p>In this example, the defect in the data pipeline (<em>lack of robust data validation and error handling</em>) led to an error (<em>transformation script termination</em>), resulting in a failure (<em>dashboard not updated with the latest sales data</em>).
Understanding the distinction between defects, errors, and failures helps diagnose issues within systems and implement effective countermeasures to prevent recurrence.</p>

<p>Avoidance</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/fault_prevention_avoidance.html#admonition-avoidance"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><em>Avoidance</em> aims to limit the introduction of potentially defective data and objects during the execution of the process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Fault prevention through avoidance is a proactive approach to reducing the likelihood of errors and defects in data systems.
It involves implementing measures and practices that ensure the quality and integrity of data and system components from the outset before problems can arise.
The ultimate goal is to create a secure and robust environment that minimizes the introduction or propagation of faults during data processing and handling.</p>
<p>Key strategies in fault prevention via avoidance include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Utilizing Reliable Data Sources</strong>:
Minimize the risk of incorporating erroneous or low-quality data into the system by ensuring data inputs are sourced from verified and trusted sources.</p>
<div id="admonition-example" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">

<div>
<p>A financial analytics firm exclusively uses financial data from regulatory-approved and audited sources to ensure the accuracy and reliability of its market analysis models.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Cleaning and Validation</strong>:
Implement systematic processes to clean and validate data before it enters the system, removing inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information to maintain data quality.</p>
<div id="admonition-example-1" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">

<p>A data engineering team routinely ingests customer data from various sources into a data lake.
To prevent the introduction of defective data, they implement an automated ETL pipeline that includes steps for cleaning data (e.g., removing duplicates) and validating against predefined schemas before storage.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Database Integrity Checks</strong>:
Regularly check the availability and integrity of tables, columns, and relationships within databases to prevent data structure-related issues.</p>
<div id="admonition-example-2" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">

<p>An analytics engineering team discovers that some reports are failing due to missing fields in the database.
They implement a nightly database integrity check that verifies the presence and correct data type of critical columns and alerts the team to any discrepancies.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Branch Operators in Data Flow</strong>:
Use branch operators or conditional logic to manage data flow effectively, ensuring that data is processed and routed correctly based on predefined criteria.</p>
<div id="admonition-example-3" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Example</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>In a data pipeline managing e-commerce transactions, conditional branching assesses the transaction volume and diversity of payment methods.
It then routes high-volume or diverse payment data to sequential processing tasks, each tailored to a specific payment method, ensuring stability, while lower volumes are directed to parallel tasks for quicker processing, optimizing both resource utilization and processing accuracy.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code Quality Practices</strong>:
Enforce rigorous code review processes and adhere to standardized coding conventions and best practices to prevent bugs and vulnerabilities in the system's software components.</p>
<div id="admonition-example-4" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">

</div>
<div>
<p>In a Python codebase, automated tools like Nix orchestrate a suite of linters (Ruff, Black, Isort) and type checkers (Mypy, Pylance) alongside formatters and beautifiers, enforcing code quality standards with predefined minimum scores, e.g., Ruff &gt; 96%.
Additionally, Nix executes tests and safety checks, while Poetry manages dependency updates, all triggered automatically on commit or push to maintain a clean, secure, and up-to-date codebase.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automated Testing</strong>:

<blockquote>
<p>The second phase of fault prevention is fault elimination. This phase typically involves procedures to find and eliminate the causes of errors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although techniques such as code reviews (e.g. linters) and local debugging are used, peer reviews and exhaustive testing with various combinations of input states and environments are not always carried out.</p>
<p>QA testing cannot verify that output values are compatible with the business and its applications, so it usually focuses on time-related failure modes (such as timeouts) and <strong>defects</strong>. Unfortunately, system testing cannot be exhaustive and eliminate all potential faults, mainly due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tests are used to demonstrate the presence of faults, not their absence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The difficulty of performing tests in production. Testing failures in production are akin to <strong>live combat</strong>, meaning the consequences of errors can directly impact the business, leading to potentially poor decisions. For example, an incorrect calculation of a KPI can lead to erroneous actions and decrease the business's confidence in the data processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors introduced during the system requirements stage may not manifest until the system is operational. For example, a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is scheduled to run when the data source is not yet available or complete. For this specific example, sensors might be implemented to only continue the execution when the data source is available or fail if not available within a particular timeframe (timeout).</p>

<p>A data ingestion pipeline is designed without error handling or validation mechanisms.

</div>
</li>

<p><strong>Controlled degradation</strong> (or graceful degradation): notifications are triggered in the presence of faults, and if they are significant enough to interrupt the task flow (thresholds, non-existence, or unavailability of data), branch operators will select the subsequent tasks.</p>

<p>A financial reporting pipeline monitors the quality of incoming transaction data.

This ensures that reports are still generated, albeit with reduced granularity, until the data quality issue is resolved.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fail-safe</strong>: detected faults are significant enough to determine that the process should not occur; a short-circuit or circuit breaker operator cancels the execution of subsequent tasks, stakeholders are notified, and if there is no automatic process to deal with the problem, the data team can take actions such as rerunning the processes that generate the necessary inputs or escalating the case.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>All available fault techniques include adding external elements to the system to detect and recover from faults.
These elements are redundant in the sense that they are not necessary for the system's normal operation; this is called <strong>protective redundancy</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The goal of tolerance is to minimize redundancy while maximizing reliability, always under system complexity and size constraints. <em>Care must be taken when designing fault-tolerant systems, as components increase the complexity and maintenance of the entire system, which can in itself lead to less reliable systems</em>.</p>

  </figure>
</p>
<p>Systems Redundancy is classified into static and dynamic.
<strong>Static redundancy</strong>, or masking, involves using redundant components to hide the effects of faults.
<strong>Dynamic redundancy</strong> is redundancy within a component that makes it indicate, implicitly or explicitly, that the output is erroneous; another component must provide recovery.
Dynamic redundancy involves not just the indication that an output is erroneous but also the system's ability to adapt or reconfigure in response to detected errors.</p>
<div id="admonition-static-redundancy-example" class="admonition admonish-example">
<div class="admonition-title">
<p>Static Redundancy Example</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/fault_tolerance.html#admonition-static-redundancy-example"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In a database system, static redundancy is implemented through mirroring, where data is replicated across multiple storage devices or locations in real time.
If one storage device fails, the system can seamlessly switch to a mirrored device without data loss or service interruption, effectively masking the fault from the end-users.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>A self-healing database cluster uses dynamic redundancy by continuously monitoring the health of its nodes.
If a node shows signs of failure, the cluster automatically initiates failover procedures to another node and possibly starts a replacement process for the faulty node, ensuring database availability and integrity with minimal manual intervention.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The key difference between static and dynamic redundancy is the approach to fault tolerance.
Static redundancy relies on duplicate resources ready to take over in case of failure, providing a straightforward but potentially resource-intensive solution.
On the other hand, dynamic redundancy incorporates intelligence and adaptability into the system, allowing it to respond to changing conditions and failures more efficiently, often with less overhead.</p>
<p>Whether static or dynamic, this fault tolerance technique has four phases: <strong>error detection</strong>, <strong>damage confinement and assessment</strong>, <strong>error recovery</strong>, and <strong>failure treatment and service continuation</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="1-error-detection"><a class="header" href="#1-error-detection">1. Error Detection</a></h3>
<p>No fault tolerance action will be taken until an error has been detected.</p>
<div id="admonition-default" class="admonition admonish-tip">
<div>
<p>The effectiveness of a fault-tolerant system depends on the <strong>effectiveness of error detection</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Error detection is classified into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental detections</strong>: Errors are detected in the operational environment of the system, which are typically managed through exception-handling mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Application detection</strong>: Errors are identified in the application itself.
<ul>
<li><strong>Reverse checks</strong>: Applied in components with an isomorphic relationship (one-to-one) between input and output. This method calculates an input value from the output value, which is then compared with the original. Inexact comparison techniques must be adopted when dealing with real numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Rationality checks</strong>: Based on the design and construction knowledge of the system. They verify that the state of the data or the value of an object is reasonable based on its intended use.</li>

<h3 id="2-damage-confinement-and-assessment"><a class="header" href="#2-damage-confinement-and-assessment">2. Damage Confinement and Assessment</a></h3>
<p>When an error is detected, the extent of the system that has been corrupted and its scope must be estimated (error diagnosis).</p>
<div id="admonition-default-1" class="admonition admonish-tip">
<div>
<p>There will always be a time magnitude between the occurrence of a defect and the detection of the error, making it essential to assess any damage that may have occurred in this time interval.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Although the type of error detected can help evaluate the damage - when performing the error handling routine - erroneous information could have been disseminated through the system and its environment.
Thus, damage assessment is directly related to the precautions taken by the system designer for damage confinement.
Damage confinement refers to structuring the system in such a way as to minimize the damage caused by a faulty component.</p>
<p><strong>Modular decomposition</strong> and <strong>atomic actions</strong> are two main techniques for structuring systems to facilitate damage confinement.
Modular decomposition means that systems should be broken down into components, each represented by one or more modules.
The interaction of the components occurs through well-defined interfaces, and the internal details of the modules are hidden and not directly accessible from the outside.
This structuring makes it more difficult for an error in one component to propagate to another.</p>
<p>Modular decomposition provides a static structure, while atomic actions structure the system dynamically.
An action is said to be atomic if there are no interactions between the activity and the system during the action.
These actions move the system from one consistent state to another and restrict information flow between components.</p>
<p>Both strategies contribute to damage confinement and system reliability by reducing the complexity and interdependencies that can lead to widespread system failures.</p>

<p>Modular Decomposition and Atomic Actions Example</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/fault_tolerance.html#admonition-modular-decomposition-and-atomic-actions-example"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Scenario</strong>:
A data analytics platform is designed to ingest, process, and visualize data from various sources, providing insights to business users.
The platform comprises several microservices, including data ingestion, processing, storage, and visualization services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modular Decomposition</strong>:
The platform is divided into separate microservices, each responsible for a specific aspect of the data pipeline.
For instance, the data ingestion service is distinct from the data processing service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Atomic Actions</strong>:
One critical task in the data processing microservice is transforming raw data into a format that can be analyzed.
This transformation process is designed to be an atomic action.
It either completes successfully and moves the data to the next stage or, in the event of a failure, entirely rolls back all changes, leaving the system in its original state without any partial modifications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>The modular approach in this example separates individual components to make them easier to maintain and update without affecting others.
For instance, if the data processing service needs to be updated or replaced, it can be done independently of the ingestion and visualization services.
The atomic actions example ensures data integrity and consistency.
If the transformation operation encounters an error, such as a format inconsistency, the atomic design prevents partially transformed, potentially incorrect data from progressing through the pipeline.
This maintains the reliability of the data output and the overall system.</p>
<h3 id="3-error-recovery"><a class="header" href="#3-error-recovery">3. Error Recovery</a></h3>
<p>Error recovery procedures begin once the detected error state and its possible damages have been assessed.</p>
<div id="admonition-default-2" class="admonition admonish-tip">
<div>
<p>This phase is the most important within fault tolerance techniques.
It must transform an erroneous system state into another from which it can continue its normal operation, perhaps with some service degradation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Forward recovery</strong> and <strong>backward recovery</strong> are the most common error recovery strategies.
The forward error recovery attempts to continue from the erroneous state by making selective corrections to the system's state, including protecting any aspect of the controlled environment that could be put at risk or damaged by the failure.</p>
<p>The backward recovery strategy consists of restoring the system to a safe state before the one in which the error occurred and then executing an alternative section of the task.
This section will have the same functionality as the section that produced the defect but using a different algorithm.
It is expected that this alternative will not produce the same defect as the previous version so that it will rely on the designer's knowledge of the possible failure modes of this component.</p>
<p>The designer must be clear about the service degradation levels, considering the services and processes that depend on it. Error recovery is part of the <a href="concepts/systems-reliability/./corrective_actions.html">Corrective Action and Preventive Action processes (CAPA)</a>.</p>

<p>In a data aggregation pipeline summarizing daily social media engagement, specific post data is missing due to an outage in the platform's post-detail API for a particular subset of posts.
The pipeline implements a forward error recovery strategy by utilizing aggregate engagement data available from an alternative API with a different granularity (post type instead of individual posts).
This aggregate data and historical individual post engagement patterns are used to estimate the missing data for individual posts.
An alert is generated to notify the data team of the estimation used and advises a rerun of the pipeline once the platform confirms the API is fully operational, ensuring continuity and accuracy of the engagement summary.</p>

<p>Backward Error Recovery Example</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/fault_tolerance.html#admonition-backward-error-recovery-example"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Consider a scenario where a database update operation is part of a larger transaction in an e-commerce application.
If an error occurs during the update—perhaps due to a database constraint violation or an unexpected interruption—the backward error recovery mechanism would involve rolling back the entire transaction to its state before the update attempt.
This could be achieved through transaction logs or savepoints that allow the system to revert to a known good state.
After the rollback, an alternative update operation that corrects the cause of the original error (e.g., adjusting the data to meet constraints) can be attempted, or the system can alert an operator to resolve the issue manually.
This ensures the database remains consistent and free from partial updates that could lead to data integrity issues.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Both forward and backward error recovery strategies aim to restore the system to a state where normal operations can continue, either by moving past the error with a best-guess approach (forward) or by returning to a safe previous state (backward), thereby maintaining the overall integrity and reliability of the system.</p>
<h3 id="4-failure-treatment-and-continued-service"><a class="header" href="#4-failure-treatment-and-continued-service">4. Failure Treatment and Continued Service</a></h3>

<p>An error is a symptom of a defect and can lead to a failure.

<h2 id="final-thoughts-on-fault-tolerance"><a class="header" href="#final-thoughts-on-fault-tolerance">Final Thoughts on Fault Tolerance</a></h2>
<p>A well-designed fault tolerance strategy encompasses not only the implementation of redundancy and error detection mechanisms but also a comprehensive approach to system design that anticipates potential failures and mitigates their impact.</p>
<p>Incorporating both static and dynamic redundancy, along with robust error detection and recovery techniques, allows systems to maintain their functionality and integrity even in the face of hardware malfunctions, software bugs, or external disruptions.
This resilience is particularly vital in data engineering, analytics, and business intelligence contexts, where data accuracy and availability underpin critical decision-making processes.</p>
<p>As systems grow in complexity and scale, the importance of fault tolerance will only increase.
Adopting a mindset that prioritizes fault tolerance from the early stages of system design can transform potential vulnerabilities into strengths, ensuring that data systems can withstand challenges and continue to deliver value reliably.</p>
<p>Ultimately, fault tolerance is not just a set of technical solutions but a fundamental aspect of system architecture and operational culture that champions reliability, adaptability, and continuous improvement.<p><hr/></p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Accurate and rapid prediction of failures enables us to achieve higher service availability of the systems we're dealing with.
Failure prediction is much more complex than detecting and not as simple as preventing, avoiding, and eliminating it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A failure must be identifiable and classified to be predicted. Failures must also be predictable, meaning state changes in any part of the system, be it at the component level or the system as a whole, can lead to failures. These cases can be translated into time series prediction problems, and logging data can be used to train prediction models.</p>
<p>The collected data will hardly be ready for use by prediction models, so one or more preprocessing tasks must be carried out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data synchronization</strong>: metrics collected by various agents must be aligned in time.</li>
<li><strong>Data cleaning</strong>: removing unnecessary data and generating missing data (e.g., interpolation).</li>
<li><strong>Data normalization</strong>: metric values are normalized to make magnitudes comparable.</li>
<li><strong>Feature selection</strong>: relevant metrics are identified for use in the models.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon preprocessing, the data advances into two primary pipelines essential for the model's application: the training pipeline and the inference pipeline.</p>
<p>The <strong>training pipeline</strong> utilizes a comprehensive set of historical data, commonly referred to as the "training dataset," to train the model.
This stage is crucial because it's where the model learns to recognize patterns and anomalies indicative of failures from historical instances.
The aim is to equip the model with the capability to accurately identify potential failures in subsequent data sets.</p>
<p>Following the training phase, the model is deployed in the <strong>inference pipeline</strong>.
In this stage, the model is applied to new, unseen data to make predictions or identify failures.
The inference process meticulously evaluates each data point against the patterns learned during training to determine the likelihood of failure.</p>
<p>The output from the inference pipeline is critical as it identifies whether specific failure patterns learned during training are present in the new data.</p>

<h2 id="workflow-orchestration-tools--kubernetes-operators"><a class="header" href="#workflow-orchestration-tools--kubernetes-operators">Workflow Orchestration Tools &amp; Kubernetes Operators</a></h2>
<p>Using workflow orchestration tools like Apache Airflow to trigger tasks inside containers managed by Kubernetes, rather than processing and transforming data locally, offers several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>:
Containers can be easily scaled up or down in Kubernetes based on the workload, meaning that as data processing demands increase, the system can dynamically allocate more resources to maintain performance, which is more challenging with local processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resource Efficiency</strong>:
Kubernetes optimizes underlying resources, ensuring containers use only the resources they need, leading to more efficient resource utilization compared to running processes locally, where resource allocation might not be as finely tuned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolation</strong>:
Running tasks in containers ensures that each task operates in its isolated environment. This isolation reduces the risk of conflicts between dependencies of different tasks and improves security by limiting the scope of access for each task.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Resolving entities in the context of Master Data and Master Data Management (MDM) is crucial for ensuring consistency, accuracy, and a single source of truth for core business entities such as customers, products, employees, suppliers, etc. Entity resolution involves identifying, linking, and merging records that refer to the same real-world entities across different systems and datasets.</p>
<p>Here's how entity resolution can be approached:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identification</strong>:
The first step involves identifying potential matches among entities across different systems or datasets. This can be challenging due to variations in data entry, abbreviations, misspellings, or incomplete records. Techniques Used: Pattern matching, fuzzy matching, and using algorithms that can handle variations and typos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deduplication</strong>:
Deduplication involves removing duplicate records of the same entity within a single dataset or system. This step is crucial to prevent redundancy and ensure each entity is represented once. Techniques Used: Hashing, similarity scoring, and machine learning models to recognize duplicates even when data is not identical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linking</strong>:
Linking is the process of associating related records across different datasets or systems that refer to the same real-world entity. This step creates a unified view of each entity. Techniques Used: Record linkage techniques, probabilistic matching, and reference matching where a common identifier or set of identifiers is used to link records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Merging</strong>:
Merging involves consolidating linked records into a single, comprehensive record that provides a complete view of the entity. Decisions must be made about which data elements to retain, merge, or discard. Techniques Used: Survivorship rules that define which attributes to keep (e.g., most recent, most complete, source-specific priorities).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Enrichment</strong>:
After resolving and merging entities, data enrichment can be applied to enhance the master records with additional information from external sources, improving the depth and value of the master data. Techniques Used: Integrating third-party data, leveraging public datasets, and using APIs to fetch additional information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Monitoring and Updating</strong>:
Entity resolution is not a one-time task. Continuous monitoring and updating are necessary to accommodate new data, changes to existing entities, and evolving relationships among entities. Techniques Used: Implementing feedback loops, periodic reviews, and automated monitoring systems to identify and resolve new or changed entities.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="4-variants-of-master-data-architecture"><a class="header" href="#4-variants-of-master-data-architecture">4 Variants of Master Data Architecture</a></h3>
<p>Jochen and Weisbecker (2014) proposed four variants of master data architecture to address different organizational needs and data management strategies. Each variant offers a unique approach to handling master data, considering factors like centralization, data governance, and system integration. Here's a summary of each:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Centralized Master Data Management</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This architecture involves a single, centralized repository where all master data is stored and managed. It serves as the authoritative source for all master data across the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Ensures consistency and uniformity of master data across the enterprise, simplifies governance, and reduces data redundancy.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges</strong>: Requires significant investment in a centralized system, can lead to bottlenecks, and may be less responsive to local or departmental needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decentralized Master Data Management</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: In this variant, master data is managed locally within different departments or business units without a central repository. Each unit maintains its master data.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Offers flexibility and allows departments to manage data according to their specific needs and processes, enabling quicker responses to local requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges</strong>: Increases the risk of data inconsistencies across the organization, complicates data integration efforts, and makes enterprise-wide data governance more challenging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Registry Model</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: The registry model uses a centralized registry that stores references (links or keys) to master data but not the master data itself. The actual data remains in local systems.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Provides a unified view of where master data is located across the organization without centralizing the data itself, facilitating data integration and consistency checks.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges</strong>: Does not eliminate data redundancies and may require complex synchronization mechanisms to ensure data consistency across systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hub and Spoke Model</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This architecture features a central hub where master data is consolidated, synchronized, and distributed to various "spoke" systems throughout the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Balances centralization and decentralization by allowing data to be managed centrally while also supporting local system requirements. It facilitates data sharing and consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges</strong>: Can be complex to implement and maintain, requiring robust integration and data synchronization capabilities between the hub and spoke systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these master data architecture variants offers distinct benefits and poses unique challenges, making them suitable for different organizational contexts and data management objectives. The choice among these variants depends on factors such as the organization's size, complexity, data governance maturity, and specific business needs.</p>
<h3 id="information-architecture-principles"><a class="header" href="#information-architecture-principles">Information Architecture Principles</a></h3>
<p>Information Architecture (IA) principles guide the design and organization of information to make it accessible and usable. In the context of master data management, these principles help ensure that master data is effectively organized and can support business needs.</p>
<p>Key Principles:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="master-data-management-maturity-models"><a class="header" href="#master-data-management-maturity-models">Master Data Management Maturity Models</a></h2>
<p>Master Data Management (MDM) maturity models are frameworks that help organizations assess their current state of MDM practices and identify areas for improvement to achieve more effective management of their master data.</p>
<p>MDM maturity models typically outline a series of stages or levels through which an organization progresses as it improves its master data management capabilities. These models often start with an initial stage characterized by ad-hoc and uncoordinated master data efforts and progress through more sophisticated stages involving standardized processes, integrated systems, and eventually, optimized and business-aligned MDM practices.</p>
<p>The levels in an MDM maturity model might include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial/Ad-Hoc</strong>: Master data is managed in an uncoordinated way, often within siloed departments.</li>
<li><strong>Repeatable</strong>: Some processes are defined, and there might be local consistency within departments, but efforts are not yet standardized across the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Defined</strong>: Organization-wide standards and policies for MDM are established, leading to greater consistency and control.</li>
<li><strong>Managed</strong>: MDM processes are monitored and measured, and data quality is actively managed across the enterprise.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized</strong>: Continuous improvement processes are in place, and MDM is fully aligned with business strategy, driving value and innovation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="loshins-mdm-maturity-model"><a class="header" href="#loshins-mdm-maturity-model">Loshin's MDM Maturity Model</a></h3>
<p>David Loshin's MDM maturity model is particularly insightful because it not only outlines stages of maturity but also focuses on the alignment of MDM processes with business objectives, emphasizing the strategic role of master data in driving business success.</p>
<p>Loshin's model includes the following key stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness</strong>: The organization recognizes the importance of master data but lacks formal management practices.</li>
<li><strong>Concept/Definition</strong>: Initial efforts to define master data and understand its impact on business processes are undertaken.</li>
<li><strong>Construction and Integration</strong>: Systems and processes are developed for managing master data, with a focus on integrating MDM into existing IT infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Operationalization</strong>: MDM processes are put into operation, and the organization starts to see benefits in terms of data consistency and quality.</li>
<li><strong>Governance</strong>: Formal governance structures are established to ensure ongoing data quality, compliance, and alignment with business objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization</strong>: The organization continuously improves its MDM practices, leveraging master data as a strategic asset to drive business innovation and value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loshin emphasizes the importance of not just the technical aspects of MDM but also the governance, organizational, and strategic components. The model encourages organizations to progress from merely managing data to leveraging it as a key factor in strategic decision-making and business process optimization.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="maturity-model"><a class="header" href="#maturity-model">Maturity Model</a></h3>
<p>The DAMA DMBOK also introduces a Maturity Model to help organizations assess their current data management capabilities and identify areas for improvement. The model outlines different levels of maturity, from initial/ad-hoc processes to optimized and managed data management practices. Organizations can use this model to benchmark their data management practices against industry standards, set realistic goals for improvement, and develop a roadmap for advancing their data management capabilities.</p>
<p>The model consists of 6 levels:</p>
<h4 id="level-0-non-existent"><a class="header" href="#level-0-non-existent">Level 0: Non-existent</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Data management practices are absent or chaotic. There is no formal recognition of the value of data management, leading to inconsistent, unreliable data handling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One example is a small startup with no dedicated data management policies or roles, where data is managed ad-hoc by whoever needs it. To advance to the next level of maturity, the company should recognize the value of structured data management and start developing basic data handling policies and procedures.</p>
<h4 id="level-1-initialad-hoc"><a class="header" href="#level-1-initialad-hoc">Level 1: Initial/Ad Hoc</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Some data management activities occur, but they are informal and inconsistent. There's a lack of standardized processes, leading to inefficiencies and data quality issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One example is a growing business where individual departments manage their data independently, resulting in siloed and inconsistent data practices. To advance to the next maturity level, companies should begin to standardize data management practices across projects or teams and appoint individuals responsible for overseeing data quality and consistency.</p>
<h4 id="level-2-repeatable"><a class="header" href="#level-2-repeatable">Level 2: Repeatable</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The organization has developed and applied data management practices that can be repeated across projects or teams. However, these practices may not yet be uniformly enforced or optimized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One example is a medium-sized enterprise where certain departments have established successful data management routines that are recognized and beginning to be adopted by other parts of the organization. To advance to the next maturity level, companies should formalize data management practices into documented policies and procedures, ensuring consistency across the organization.</p>
<h4 id="level-3-defined"><a class="header" href="#level-3-defined">Level 3: Defined</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Data management processes are documented, standardized, and integrated into daily operations across the organization. There's a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities related to data management.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="seis-data-management-maturity-model-dmm"><a class="header" href="#seis-data-management-maturity-model-dmm">SEI's Data Management Maturity Model (DMM)</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The DMM model is particularly useful for organizations seeking a structured approach to assessing and improving their data management maturity, with clear categories and maturity levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the SEI's DMM, DAMA DMBOK, and Aiken's Model all aim to improve data management practices, they have different focuses and structures. SEI's DMM offers a comprehensive and structured assessment model focusing on maturity levels across specific categories of data management. It is particularly useful for organizations looking to benchmark their data management capabilities and develop a roadmap for improvement.</p>
<p>The Data Management Maturity (DMM) Model developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) provides a structured framework for assessing and improving an organization's data management practices. The model is organized into six categories, each focusing on a different aspect of data management:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Governance</strong>: Focuses on establishing the policies, responsibilities, and processes to ensure effective data management and utilization across the organization.
Example: A financial institution implements a data governance committee to oversee data policies, ensuring compliance with financial regulations and internal data standards.</li>
<li><strong>Data Quality</strong>: Focuses on ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle.
Example: An e-commerce company develops automated data quality checks within its product information management system to ensure product descriptions and pricing are accurate and up-to-date.</li>
<li><strong>Data Operations</strong>: Focuses on managing the day-to-day activities involved in data collection, storage, maintenance, and archiving.
Example: A healthcare provider standardizes its patient data entry processes across all clinics to streamline data collection and reduce errors.</li>
<li><strong>Platform and Architecture</strong>: Focuses on establishing the technical infrastructure and architecture to support data management needs.
Example: A technology startup adopts cloud-based data storage solutions and microservices architecture to enhance scalability and data integration capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Data Management Process</strong>: Focuses on defining and optimizing the processes involved in managing data, from creation to retirement.
Example: A manufacturing company maps out its entire data flow, from raw material procurement data to production and sales data, optimizing each step for efficiency and accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Supporting Processes</strong>: Focuses on implementing auxiliary processes that support core data management activities, such as security, privacy, and compliance.
Example: An online retailer enhances its data encryption practices and implements stricter access controls to protect customer data and comply with privacy regulations.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="dmm-model-maturity-levels"><a class="header" href="#dmm-model-maturity-levels">DMM Model Maturity Levels</a></h3>
<p>The DMM Model is structured around specific maturity levels that describe an organization's progression in data management capabilities, focusing on measurable improvements across various categories like Data Governance, Data Quality, and Data Operations. The levels typically range from:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ad Hoc</strong>: Data management practices are unstructured and inconsistent.</li>
<li><strong>Managed</strong>: Basic data management processes are in place but are department-specific.</li>
<li><strong>Standardized</strong>: Organization-wide data management standards and policies are established.</li>
<li><strong>Quantitatively Managed</strong>: Data management processes are measured and controlled.</li>
<li><strong>Optimizing</strong>: Continuous process improvement is embedded in data management practices.</li>

<h2 id="automating-accuracy-measurement-with-airflow"><a class="header" href="#automating-accuracy-measurement-with-airflow">Automating Accuracy Measurement with Airflow</a></h2>
<p>Airflow provides a robust way to automate and monitor data workflows, and you can extend its capabilities by using sensors and operators to measure the accuracy of your data as it moves through the various stages of your pipeline.</p>
<p>For the examples below, let's imagine a scenario where AWS DMS loads data from multiple databases into Redshift, and dbt models transform the data to create Data Marts. Here are some Sensors and Operators for Accuracy Measurement in Airflow:</p>
<h3 id="dms-task-sensor"><a class="header" href="#dms-task-sensor">DMS Task Sensor</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Monitors the state of an AWS Data Migration Service (DMS) task.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can extend this sensor to query the source and target databases after the DMS task is completed, comparing record counts or checksums to ensure data has been transferred correctly. The <em>Accuracy</em> metric could be measured as:</p>
<p>\[ Accuracy = \frac{Number \ of \ Records \ in \ Target}{Total \ Number \ of \ Records \ in \ Source} \times 100 \]</p>
<h3 id="sql-check-operator"><a class="header" href="#sql-check-operator">SQL Check Operator</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Executes an SQL query and checks the result against a predefined condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Run integrity checks such as COUNT(*) on both source and target tables, and use this operator to compare the counts. The <em>Accuracy</em> metric could be measured in this case as:</p>
<p>\[ Accuracy = \frac{Number \ of \ Records \ in \ Target}{Total \ Number \ of \ Records \ in \ Source} \times 100 \]</p>
<h3 id="sql-value-check-operator"><a class="header" href="#sql-value-check-operator">SQL Value Check Operator</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Executes a SQL query and ensures that the returned value meets a certain condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perform field-level data validation by selecting key fields and comparing them between the source and the target after a DMS task. The <em>Field Accuracy</em> metric could be measured as:</p>
<p>\[ Field \ Accuracy = \frac{Number \ of \ Matching \ Field \ Values}{Total \ Number \ of \ Field \ Values \ Checked} \times 100 \]</p>
<h3 id="dbt-run-operator"><a class="header" href="#dbt-run-operator">dbt Run Operator</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Executes dbt run to run transformation models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the dbt run, use dbt's built-in test functionality to perform accuracy checks on transformed data against source data or expected results. The <em>Transformation Accuracy</em> metric could be measured as:</p>
<p>\[ Transformation \ Accuracy = \frac{Number \ of \ Pass \ Tests}{Total \ Number \ of \ Tests} \times 100 \]</p>
<h3 id="data-quality-operator"><a class="header" href="#data-quality-operator">Data Quality Operator</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A custom operator that you can define to implement data quality checks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incorporate various data quality checks like hash total comparisons, data profiling, anomaly detection, and more complex validations that may not be directly supported by built-in operators. The <em>Accuracy</em> metric could be measured as:</p>
<p>\[ Accuracy = (1 - \frac{Number \ of \ Pass \ Tests}{Total \ Number \ of \ Tests}) \times 100 \]</p>
<h3 id="python-operator"><a class="header" href="#python-operator">Python Operator</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Executes a Python callable (function) to perform custom logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use this operator to implement custom accuracy metrics, like calculating the percentage of records within an acceptable deviation range from a golden dataset or source of truth. The metrics here will be based on the specific accuracy check implemented in the Python function.</p>
<h3 id="sensors--operators"><a class="header" href="#sensors--operators">Sensors &amp; Operators</a></h3>
<p>In your Airflow DAGs, you would typically sequence these sensors and operators such that the DMS Task Sensor runs first to ensure the DMS task has been completed. Following that, the <em>SQL Check</em> and <em>SQL Value Check Operators</em> can verify the accuracy of the data transfer.</p>
<p>Post-transformation, the <em>dbt Run Operator</em> along with additional data quality checks using the <em>Python Operator</em> or a custom <em>Data Quality Operator</em> can be used to ensure the accuracy of the dbt transformations.</p>
<p>It's important to note that while these checks can provide a good indication of data accuracy, they are most effective when part of a comprehensive data quality framework that includes regular reviews, stakeholder feedback, and iterative improvements to the checks themselves. Moreover, the exact mathematical formulas might need to be adapted to the specific requirements and context of your data and business rules.</p>
<h2 id="ensuring-and-improving-accuracy"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-and-improving-accuracy">Ensuring and Improving Accuracy</a></h2>

<p>Below is a conceptual example of how metrics records might be structured within a metrics database:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">-- Table structure for 'data_quality_metric_records'
CREATE TABLE data_quality_metric_records (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    metric_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    metric_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    metric_formula TEXT NOT NULL,
    metric_value NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,
    source_system VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    target_system VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    data_domain VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    measurement_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    notes TEXT
);

-- Sample entries for metrics
INSERT INTO data_quality_metric_records (metric_type, metric_name, metric_formula, metric_value, source_system, target_system, data_domain, notes)
VALUES
('Completeness', 'Record Completeness', '(Number of Complete Records / Total Number of Records) * 100', 97.50, 'Postgres', 'S3', 'Sales', 'Monthly sales data completeness.'),
('Completeness', 'Field Completeness', '(Number of Fields without NULLs / Total Number of Fields) * 100', 99.30, 'Oracle', 'Redshift', 'Customer', 'Customer data fields completeness.'),
('Completeness', 'Data Mart Completeness', '(Number of Complete Data Mart Records / Total Expected Records) * 100', 98.75, 'MariaDB', 'Data Mart', 'Inventory', 'Inventory data mart completeness after dbt transformation.'),
('Completeness', 'ELT Completeness', '(Number of Records Loaded by DMS / Number of Records in Source) * 100', 99.80, 'All Sources', 'Data Lake (S3)', 'All Domains', 'Completeness of the ELT process monitored by DMS tasks.');

-- Query to retrieve the latest metrics for the 'Sales' data domain
SELECT * FROM data_quality_metric_records
WHERE data_domain = 'Sales'
ORDER BY measurement_time DESC
LIMIT 1;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code> is a unique identifier for each metric record.</li>
<li><code>metric_type</code> describes the metric dimension (Accuracy, Completeness, etc.) being measured.</li>
<li><code>metric_name</code> describes the type of metric being measured.</li>
<li><code>metric_formula</code> provides the formula used to calculate the metric.</li>
<li><code>metric_value</code> stores the actual metric value, in this case, a percentage.</li>
<li><code>source_system</code> and <code>target_system</code> indicate where the data is coming from and where it is being loaded to.</li>
<li><code>data_domain</code> specifies the domain or category of the data being measured (e.g., sales, customer, inventory).</li>
<li><code>measurement_time</code> records the timestamp when the measurement was taken.</li>
<li><code>notes</code> is an optional field for any additional information or context about the metric.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-quality-service"><a class="header" href="#data-quality-service">Data Quality Service</a></h2>
<p>In a practical data environment, it's crucial to organize data quality metrics and measurement tasks into separate, well-defined tables to maintain clarity and facilitate easy data management. Here's what the structure might look like:</p>
<h3 id="data_quality_metrics-tables"><a class="header" href="#data_quality_metrics-tables"><code>data_quality_metrics</code> Tables</a></h3>
<p>This table would act as a reference for all defined metrics, capturing their names, formulas, and other relevant details. As a <a href="concepts/data-quality/../data-architecture/slowly_changing_dimensions.html"><strong>Type 4 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) table</strong></a>, it would maintain in one table (<code>data_quality_metrics_history</code>), a complete history of each metric (Type 2 SCD), including when they were created or if they were ever retired (<code>deleted_at</code>), and in the main table (<code>data_quality_metrics</code>), only the current metrics (Type 1 SCD).</p>
<h3 id="data_quality_measurement_tasks-tables"><a class="header" href="#data_quality_measurement_tasks-tables"><code>data_quality_measurement_tasks</code> Tables</a></h3>
<p>This table would contain information about the measurement tasks themselves, including the system used for measurement and the specific source and target systems involved. Like the metrics table, this would also be a type 4 SCD, preserving a historical record of measurement tasks' lifecycles (<code>data_quality_measurement_tasks_history</code>), and the current tasks (<code>data_quality_measurement_tasks</code>).</p>
<h3 id="data_quality_metric_records-table"><a class="header" href="#data_quality_metric_records-table"><code>data_quality_metric_records</code> Table</a></h3>
<p>Serving as the transaction table, <code>data_quality_metric_records</code> would hold the actual records of measurements. Each record would reference the relevant metric (<code>data_quality_metrics.id</code>) and measurement task (<code>data_quality_measurement_tasks</code>), along with the unique identifier for the run (<code>run_id</code>), and a URL pointing to the relevant logs for that run (<code>run_url</code>).</p>
<h3 id="dedicated-service"><a class="header" href="#dedicated-service">Dedicated Service</a></h3>
<p>The setup would be supported by a dedicated service, tentatively named <code>data-quality-service</code>, which would facilitate the recording of measurement data, potentially through an API. The management of <code>data_quality_metrics</code> and <code>data_quality_measurement_tasks</code> through their APIs, while not detailed in this example, would be a critical part of the overall data quality infrastructure.</p>
<p>By segregating metric definitions, measurement tasks, and actual measurement records into distinct tables and managing them through a dedicated service, organizations can ensure that data quality tracking is both efficient and scalable. This approach allows for the precise pinpointing of data quality issues and facilitates a structured way to track improvements and changes over time.</p>
<h2 id="taking-action"><a class="header" href="#taking-action">Taking Action</a></h2>
<p>In a practical setup, it's crucial to not only collect data quality metrics but also to analyze, monitor, and act upon them effectively. Integrating observability tools, automating ticketing systems, utilizing data visualization platforms, leveraging communication systems, and disseminating reports are key to maintaining high data quality standards:</p>
<h3 id="observability-tools-eg-datadog"><a class="header" href="#observability-tools-eg-datadog">Observability Tools (e.g., DataDog)</a></h3>
<p>Configure DataDog to monitor <code>data_quality_metric_records</code> for significant deviations or trends in data quality metrics.</p>
<p>Set up alerts in DataDog for when metrics fall below predefined thresholds, indicating potential data quality issues.</p>
<h3 id="ticket-automation-eg-jira"><a class="header" href="#ticket-automation-eg-jira">Ticket Automation (e.g., Jira)</a></h3>
<p>Automate the creation of Jira tickets through API integration when DataDog alerts trigger, ensuring immediate action on data quality issues.</p>
<p>Include relevant details in the ticket, such as <code>metric_name</code>, <code>metric_value</code>, <code>run_url</code>, and a brief description of the potential issue for quicker resolution.</p>
<h3 id="data-visualization-dashboards-eg-tableau-powerbi"><a class="header" href="#data-visualization-dashboards-eg-tableau-powerbi">Data Visualization Dashboards (e.g., Tableau, PowerBI)</a></h3>
<p>Develop dashboards in Tableau or PowerBI that visualize key data quality metrics over time, providing a clear view of data quality trends and anomalies.</p>
<p>Enable dashboard filters by <code>source_system</code>, <code>target_system</code>, and <code>data_domain</code> for targeted analysis by different teams.</p>
<h3 id="communication-systems-eg-slack-teams"><a class="header" href="#communication-systems-eg-slack-teams">Communication Systems (e.g., Slack, Teams)</a></h3>
<p>Set up integrations with Slack or Teams to send automated notifications about critical data quality alerts, ensuring broad awareness among relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>Create dedicated channels for data quality discussions, facilitating collaborative problem-solving and updates on issue resolution.</p>
<h3 id="reports-eg-sharepoint"><a class="header" href="#reports-eg-sharepoint">Reports (e.g., SharePoint)</a></h3>
<p>Regularly generate comprehensive data quality reports that summarize the state of data quality across different domains and systems, making them accessible on SharePoint for wider organizational visibility.</p>
<p>Include insights, trend analyses, and recommendations for improvements in the reports to guide strategic data quality initiatives.</p>
<p>By employing this multifaceted approach, organizations can ensure that data quality metrics are not only tracked but also analyzed and acted upon promptly. This proactive stance on data quality management enables quicker identification and resolution of issues, maintains trust in data systems, and supports informed decision-making across the organization.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="final-thoughts-on-data-quality-dimensions"><a class="header" href="#final-thoughts-on-data-quality-dimensions">Final Thoughts on Data Quality Dimensions</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter, we explored several critical dimensions of data quality, including <a href="concepts/data-quality/./accuracy_dimension.html">Accuracy</a>, <a href="concepts/data-quality/./completeness_dimension.html">Completeness</a>, <a href="concepts/data-quality/./consistency_dimension.html">Consistency</a>, <a href="concepts/data-quality/./relevance_dimension.html">Relevance</a>, <a href="concepts/data-quality/./reliability_dimension.html">Reliability</a>, <a href="concepts/data-quality/./uniqueness_dimension.html">Uniqueness</a>, <a href="concepts/data-quality/./validity_dimension.html">Validity</a>, <a href="concepts/data-quality/./accessibility_dimension.html">Accessibility</a>, and <a href="concepts/data-quality/./integrity_dimension.html">Integrity</a>. Each of these dimensions plays a vital role in ensuring that data serves its intended purpose effectively, supporting decision-making, operational efficiency, and strategic initiatives.</p>
<p>However, it's important to recognize that not every use case will require an exhaustive focus on all these dimensions. The relevance and priority of each dimension can vary significantly depending on factors such as industry norms, organizational size, team composition, and the maturity of the data infrastructure in place.

<p>Many tools, processes, techniques, strategies, and ideas help with reliability engineering, designed to enhance the robustness and dependability of systems across various domains.
Among these, the Corrective Action System (FRACAS) is particularly notable within traditional sectors like automotive and manufacturing for its pivotal role in upholding product quality and reliability.
This systematic approach to identifying failures, analyzing root causes, and implementing corrective actions is similar to the strategies software development and data teams employ, albeit through methodologies and tools specifically adapted to their unique challenges.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that some of the methodologies presented stem from diverse engineering fields such as software, mechanical, or industrial engineering.
Their use in data reliability engineering may be limited, primarily because the data industry has evolved its own set of specialized tools.
However, exploring how traditional industries employ these methods can inspire innovative approaches to enhancing the reliability of data systems.
You'll find here an extension to the tools explored in the <a href="concepts/systems-reliability/./reliability_tools.html">Reliability Toolkit</a> chapters, offering a broader perspective on the cross-functional reliability engineering principles across different disciplines.</p>
<div id="admonition-corrective-actions" class="admonition admonish-note">

<p>Corrective Actions</p>
<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/reliability_tools_appendice.html#admonition-corrective-actions"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The principle of <a href="concepts/systems-reliability/./corrective_actions.html">Corrective Actions</a> focuses on identifying, analyzing, and fixing issues to stop them from reoccurring.
It forms the foundation for methods like the Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action System (FRACAS) and the Corrective Action and Preventive Action Process (CAPA), as well as the Corrective Action Process (CAP).
Commonly used in sectors like aerospace, aviation, automotive, and more, these approaches help systematically address failures and improve operations.
Although these methods are not typically fully used by data teams or in tech sectors, their key elements are essential and often adopted in parts within data and software fields.</p>
<p>For data engineering, each step in these corrective action methods matches specific tools and practices to keep data systems safe and reliable.
These include Data Quality Management Systems to ensure data is correct, Incident Management Systems to handle data problems, Error Tracking and Monitoring Tools to spot data issues, Data Observability Platforms for insights on system performance, Change Management and Version Control for updating systems, Data Testing and Validation Frameworks to check data is correct, and Root Cause Analysis Tools to identify and understand the underlying causes of failures, and address core issues, as defects and faults.</p>
<p>Using the principle of corrective actions in data engineering, inspired by FRACAS, CAPA, and CAP's organized processes, involves a proactive approach to resolving issues.
Adapting these methods for data systems with the right tools and practices allows data teams to promote a culture of continuous improvement.
This not only makes data systems more reliable but also supports making good decisions,  contributing significantly to organizational success.</p>

<p><a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="concepts/systems-reliability/reliability_tools_appendice.html#admonition-reliability-block-diagrams-rbd"></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Reliability Block Diagrams (RBDs) are specialized graphical representations that model the reliability and functional dependencies of complex systems.
They enable engineers to visualize how each component contributes to overall system reliability.
RBDs are integral in industries such as aerospace, defense, and manufacturing, where system reliability is critical.</p>
<p>In data engineering, direct application of RBDs might be uncommon, but the principles they illustrate resonate within the field through the use of specific tools.
Data lineage tools, for instance, provide a clear visualization of data dependencies and flows, similar to how RBDs map out component relationships.
Data observability platforms extend this by offering comprehensive insights into the health and performance of each part of the data ecosystem, enabling proactive identification and resolution of issues before they escalate.
Workflow orchestration tools like Apache Airflow ensure that data processes are executed in a reliable sequence, reflecting the dependency management aspect of RBDs.
Together, these tools form a framework that enhances data systems reliability, availability, and integrity, echoing the foundational goals of RBDs in traditional engineering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As part of the Corrective Action and Preventive Action Process (CAPA), the Corrective Action Process (CAP) aims to identify failures, determine their root causes, and take corrective actions. This process also involves implementing preventive measures to avoid the recurrence of the same failure for the same reasons. You can find the complete definition in ISO 9001.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different tools and techniques are used for their application in various industries, such as PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act), DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control), 8D, etc. Typically, any tool, technique, or methodology is summarized in ISO 9001 in seven "steps":</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define the problem</strong>. This step involves confirming the problem is real and identifying the Who, What, When, Where, and Why. This step should be automated as much as possible, with the failure detected through sensors.</li>
<li><strong>Define the scope</strong>. It involves measuring the problem to be solved, knowing its frequency, which processes or tasks it affects, and which stakeholders are impacted. For data processes, many scope details should already be known from the design of the processes and tasks, and the frequency can be determined from observability and FRACAS processes.</li>
<li><strong>Containment actions</strong>. These are specific measures adopted for the shortest possible time while working on a definitive solution to the failure. Such measures should already be designed in advance for each task or sub-task. The selection of measures should be automated, or if not, they should be implemented immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Root cause identification</strong>. A clear, precise, and comprehensive failure diagnosis. Its documentation is part of the FRACAS.</li>
<li><strong>Corrective action planning</strong>. Plan corrective actions based explicitly on the root cause.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation of corrective actions</strong>. This involves the final implementation of corrective actions in the process, which should automatically be available when similar failures occur.</li>
<li><strong>Follow-up on results</strong>. Documentation, communication, complete FRACAS.</li>
</ol>
<p>Corrective Actions in data engineering involve identifying, addressing, and mitigating the root causes of identified problems within data processes and systems to prevent their recurrence. This systematic approach is crucial for maintaining the integrity, reliability, and efficiency of data operations. Here's how Corrective Actions can be applied in data engineering:</p>
<h3 id="identification-of-issues"><a class="header" href="#identification-of-issues">Identification of Issues</a></h3>
<p>The first step in the Corrective Action process is accurately identifying issues within data systems. This could range from data quality problems, pipeline failures, and performance bottlenecks to security vulnerabilities. Automated monitoring tools, data quality frameworks, and alerting systems are vital in early detection.</p>
<h3 id="root-cause-analysis-rca"><a class="header" href="#root-cause-analysis-rca">Root Cause Analysis (RCA)</a></h3>
<p>Once an issue is identified, a thorough Root Cause Analysis is conducted to understand the underlying cause of the problem. Techniques such as the Five Whys, fishbone diagrams, or Pareto analysis can be employed. For instance, if a data pipeline fails frequently due to specific data format inconsistencies, RCA would seek to uncover why these inconsistencies occur.</p>
<h3 id="planning-corrective-actions"><a class="header" href="#planning-corrective-actions">Planning Corrective Actions</a></h3>
<p>Based on the RCA findings, a corrective action plan is developed. This plan outlines the steps needed to address the root cause of the problem. In the data pipeline example, if the root cause is incorrect data formatting at the source, a corrective action could involve, for example, implementing stricter data validation checks at the data ingestion stage.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-of-corrective-actions"><a class="header" href="#implementation-of-corrective-actions">Implementation of Corrective Actions</a></h3>
<p>The planned corrective actions are then implemented. This might involve modifying data validation rules, updating ETL scripts, enhancing data quality checks, or even redesigning parts of the data pipeline for better error handling and resilience.</p>
<h3 id="verification-and-monitoring"><a class="header" href="#verification-and-monitoring">Verification and Monitoring</a></h3>
<p>After the corrective actions are implemented, verifying their effectiveness in resolving the issue and monitoring the system for unintended consequences is crucial. This could involve running test cases, monitoring data pipeline runs for a certain period, or employing data quality dashboards to ensure the issue does not recur.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-and-knowledge-sharing"><a class="header" href="#documentation-and-knowledge-sharing">Documentation and Knowledge Sharing</a></h3>
<p>All steps taken, from issue identification to implementing corrective actions and their outcomes, should be thoroughly documented. This documentation is a knowledge base for future reference and helps share learnings across the data engineering team and organization. It contributes to building a culture of continuous improvement.</p>
<h3 id="preventive-measures"><a class="header" href="#preventive-measures">Preventive Measures</a></h3>
<p>Beyond addressing the immediate issue, the insights gained during the corrective action process can inform preventive measures to avoid similar problems. This might include revising data handling policies, enhancing training for data engineers, or adopting new tools and technologies for better data management.</p>
<p>In data engineering, Corrective Actions are about fixing problems and improving processes and systems for long-term reliability and efficiency. By systematically addressing the root causes of issues, data teams can enhance the quality, security, and performance of their data infrastructure, supporting better decision-making and operational outcomes across the organization.</p>

<p>These professionals, among others, employ CAPA and CAP methodologies to systematically address issues, implement corrective actions, and prevent recurrence, ensuring quality, safety, and compliance in their respective fields.</p>
<p>Data engineers, operating within the realm of data systems and analytics, might not use the traditional CAPA &amp; CAP processes in the same way as industries with physical manufacturing or stringent regulatory compliance requirements. However, they adopt similar principles and methodologies tailored to data management, quality, and reliability. Some CAPA-like processes and alternatives more commonly used in data engineering include:</p>
<p>Data Quality Management Frameworks: These frameworks encompass processes for monitoring, managing, and improving data quality, similar to CAPA. They involve identifying data quality issues, diagnosing root causes, and implementing corrective actions to prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Incident Management Systems: Widely used in software engineering and IT operations, incident management systems like JIRA, ServiceNow, or PagerDuty help data engineers track and resolve data-related incidents, akin to CAPA's issue resolution and preventive action principles.</p>
<p>Data Observability Platforms: Tools like Monte Carlo, DataDog, or Splunk provide observability into data pipelines and systems, enabling data engineers to detect anomalies, diagnose root causes, and implement fixes, which parallels the CAPA process.</p>
<p>Data Governance Platforms: Platforms such as Collibra, Alation, and Atlan help establish policies, standards, and procedures for data management, including data quality and integrity, which reflect CAPA's focus on systemic improvement and preventive measures.</p>
<p>Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Tools: RCA techniques, often used in conjunction with incident management and observability tools, help data engineers systematically investigate and address the underlying causes of data issues, aligning with CAPA's corrective and preventive action approach.</p>
<p>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines: CI/CD practices in data engineering, involving tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions, support automated testing and deployment, allowing for rapid identification and correction of data pipeline issues, akin to CAPA's emphasis on swift, effective resolution and prevention.</p>
<p>Data Testing and Validation Frameworks: Tools like dbt (Data Build Tool), Great Expectations, or Deequ enable automated data testing and validation, ensuring data integrity and quality, which are core components of CAPA-like processes in data management.</p>
<p>Change Management Processes: In data engineering, change management processes ensure that modifications to data pipelines, schemas, and systems are thoroughly evaluated, tested, and monitored, reducing the risk of introducing data quality issues.</p>
<p>These methodologies and tools embody the spirit of CAPA in the data engineering context, focusing on ensuring data reliability, quality, and integrity through systematic issue identification, resolution, and prevention. While not labeled as CAPA explicitly, these practices serve a similar purpose in maintaining high standards for data systems and processes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD) are a method for diagramming and identifying how the reliability of components (or subsystems) <em>R(t)</em> contributes to the success or failure of a redundancy. This method can be used to design and optimize components and select redundancies, aiming to lower failure rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An RBD is a series of connected blocks (in series, parallel, or a combination thereof), indicating redundant components, the type of redundancy, and their respective failure rates.</p>
<p>The diagram displays the components that failed and the ones that did not. If it is possible to identify a path between the beginning and end of the process with components that did not fail, it can be concluded that the process can be successfully executed.</p>
<p>Each RBD should include statements listing all relationships between components, i.e., what conditions led to using one component over another in the process execution.</p>
<h2 id="rbd-implementation-in-data-engineering"><a class="header" href="#rbd-implementation-in-data-engineering">RBD Implementation in Data Engineering</a></h2>
<p>RBDs can be particularly useful in data engineering to ensure the reliability and availability of data pipelines and storage systems. Here's how RBDs could be applied in the context of data engineering:</p>
<h3 id="designing-data-pipelines"><a class="header" href="#designing-data-pipelines">Designing Data Pipelines</a></h3>
<p>Data pipelines include stages like data collection, processing, transformation, and loading (ETL processes). An RBD can represent each stage as a block, with connections illustrating the data flow. This helps identify critical components whose failure could disrupt the entire pipeline, allowing engineers to implement redundancy or failovers specifically for those components.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure-reliability"><a class="header" href="#infrastructure-reliability">Infrastructure Reliability</a></h3>
<p>In data engineering, the infrastructure includes databases, servers, network components, and storage systems. An RBD can help visualize the relationship between these components and their impact on overall system reliability. For example, a database cluster might be set up with redundancy to ensure that the failure of a single node doesn't result in data loss or downtime, represented in an RBD by parallel blocks for each redundant component.</p>
<h3 id="dependency-analysis"><a class="header" href="#dependency-analysis">Dependency Analysis</a></h3>
<p>RBDs can help data engineers understand how different data sources and processes depend on each other. For instance, if a data pipeline relies on multiple external APIs or data sources, the RBD can illustrate these dependencies, highlighting potential points of failure if one of the external sources becomes unreliable.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-redundancies"><a class="header" href="#optimizing-redundancies">Optimizing Redundancies</a></h3>
<p>By using RBDs, data engineers can identify areas where redundancies are necessary to maintain data availability and system performance. This is crucial for critical systems where data must be available at all times. For example, in a data replication strategy, the RBD can help determine the number of replicas needed to achieve the desired level of reliability.</p>
<h3 id="failure-mode-analysis"><a class="header" href="#failure-mode-analysis">Failure Mode Analysis</a></h3>
<p>RBDs allow for the identification of single points of failure within the system. Understanding how individual components contribute to the overall system reliability enables data engineers to prioritize efforts in mitigating risks, such as adding backups, introducing data validation steps, or improving error-handling mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="scalability-and-maintenance-planning"><a class="header" href="#scalability-and-maintenance-planning">Scalability and Maintenance Planning</a></h3>
<p>As data systems scale, RBDs can be updated to reflect new components and dependencies, helping engineers plan for maintenance and scalability while minimizing the impact on reliability. This foresight ensures the system can grow without compromising performance or data integrity.
In summary, Reliability Block Diagrams offer a systematic approach for data engineers to design, analyze, and optimize data systems for reliability. By visualizing component dependencies and identifying critical points of failure, RBDs facilitate informed decision-making to enhance system robustness and ensure continuous data availability.</p>

<h2 id="rbd-implementation-in-data-reliability-engineering"><a class="header" href="#rbd-implementation-in-data-reliability-engineering">RBD Implementation in Data Reliability Engineering</a></h2>
<p>While data engineering primarily uses Reliability Block Diagrams (RBDs) to design and detail the individual tasks within data pipelines, data reliability engineering adopts RBDs to assess and enhance the overall system's robustness. In the data reliability context, RBDs extend beyond the pipeline to encompass the entire data ecosystem, including data sources, storage, and processing components, focusing on how these elements collectively contribute to the system's reliability and pinpointing potential vulnerabilities that could impact data integrity and availability.</p>
<h3 id="component-identification"><a class="header" href="#component-identification">Component Identification</a></h3>
<p>Start by identifying all critical components of your data ecosystem that contribute to the overall reliability of data services. This includes data ingestion mechanisms, transformation processes (like ETL/ELT jobs), data storage systems (databases, data lakes, data warehouses), data processing applications, and data access layers.</p>
<h3 id="diagram-construction"><a class="header" href="#diagram-construction">Diagram Construction</a></h3>
<p>Construct the RBD by representing each identified component as a block. The arrangement of these blocks should reflect the logical relationship and dependencies between components, with connections indicating the data flow. For example, an ETL job block might be connected to both a source database block and a data warehouse block, showing the data flow from source to target.</p>
<h3 id="reliability-representation"><a class="header" href="#reliability-representation">Reliability Representation</a></h3>
<p>Assign reliability values to each block based on historical performance data, such as uptime, failure rates, or mean time between failures (MTBF). These values can be derived from monitoring and logging tools, past incident reports, or vendor specifications for managed services.</p>
<h3 id="analysis"><a class="header" href="#analysis">Analysis</a></h3>
<p>Use the RBD to analyze the overall system reliability. This can involve calculating the reliability of serial and parallel configurations within the diagram. The system's reliability is the product of the individual reliabilities for serial configurations (where components depend on each other). For parallel configurations (where components can compensate for each other's failure), the system's reliability is enhanced and requires a different calculation approach.</p>
<h3 id="identification-of-weak-points"><a class="header" href="#identification-of-weak-points">Identification of Weak Points</a></h3>
<p>The RBD can help identify system parts that significantly impact overall reliability. Components with lower reliability values or critical single points of failure become evident, guiding where improvements or redundancies are needed.</p>
<h3 id="redundancy-planning"><a class="header" href="#redundancy-planning">Redundancy Planning</a></h3>
<p>Based on the analysis, plan for redundancy and fault tolerance in critical components. For example, if a data storage system is identified as a weak point, consider introducing replication or a failover system to enhance reliability.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-improvement"><a class="header" href="#continuous-improvement">Continuous Improvement</a></h3>
<p>As the data system evolves, continuously update the RBD to reflect changes and improvements. Regularly revisiting the RBD can help maintain an up-to-date understanding of the system's reliability and make informed decisions about further enhancements.</p>
<h3 id="example-use-case"><a class="header" href="#example-use-case">Example Use Case</a></h3>
<p>Imagine a data platform where raw data is ingested from various sources into a data lake, processed through a series of transformation jobs in Apache Spark, and then loaded into a data warehouse for analytics. An RBD for this platform would include blocks for each data source, the data lake, Spark jobs, and the data warehouse. By analyzing the RBD, the data reliability engineering team might find that the transformation jobs are a reliability bottleneck. To address this, they could introduce redundancy by parallelizing the Spark jobs across multiple clusters, thereby enhancing the overall reliability of the data platform.</p>

These professionals, across various disciplines, leverage RBDs to quantify reliability, identify weaknesses, and inform decisions on improvements or redundancies needed to achieve desired reliability levels in their systems and projects.</p>
<p>Data engineers often adopt processes and tools that resemble aspects of Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD) but are tailored to the specific needs and challenges of data systems. Some of these processes and tools include:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Control Systems High Availability refers to the design and implementation of control systems in a way that ensures they are <strong>consistently available and operational</strong>, minimizing downtime and maintaining continuous service. <em>High availability in control systems is achieved through redundancy, fault tolerance, failover strategies, and robust system monitoring</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adapting the principles of High Availability from control systems to data reliability engineering involves ensuring that data systems and services are designed to be resilient, with minimal disruptions, and can recover quickly from failures. This can be achieved through several strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redundancy</strong>: Implementing redundant data storage and processing systems so that if one system fails, another can take over without loss of service.</li>
<li><strong>Fault Tolerance</strong>: Designing data systems to continue operating even when components fail. This might involve using distributed systems that can handle the failure of individual nodes without affecting the overall system performance.</li>
<li><strong>Failover Mechanisms</strong>: Establishing automated processes that detect system failures and seamlessly switch operations to backup systems to maintain service continuity.</li>
<li><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: Distributing data processing and queries across multiple servers to prevent any single point of failure and to manage load efficiently, ensuring consistent performance.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Data Backups</strong>: Maintaining frequent and reliable data backups to enable quick data restoration in the event of data loss or corruption.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Alerts</strong>: Implementing comprehensive monitoring of data systems to detect issues proactively, with alerting mechanisms that notify relevant personnel to take immediate action.</li>
<li><strong>Disaster Recovery Planning</strong>: Developing and regularly testing disaster recovery plans that outline clear steps for restoring data services in the event of significant system failures or catastrophic events.</li>
</ul>
<p>By incorporating these high availability strategies into data systems design and management, data reliability engineers can ensure that data services are robust, resilient, and capable of maintaining high levels of service availability, even in the face of system failures or unexpected disruptions.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how principles of Control Systems High Availability can be adapted to data reliability engineering:</p>
<h3 id="scenario"><a class="header" href="#scenario">Scenario</a></h3>
<p>A company relies heavily on its customer data platform (CDP) to deliver personalized marketing campaigns. The CDP integrates data from various sources, including e-commerce transactions, customer service interactions, and social media engagement. High availability of this platform is crucial to ensure continuous marketing operations and customer engagement.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-of-high-availability-strategies"><a class="header" href="#implementation-of-high-availability-strategies">Implementation of High Availability Strategies</a></h3>
<h4 id="redundancy-1"><a class="header" href="#redundancy-1">Redundancy</a></h4>
<p>The CDP is hosted on a cloud platform that automatically replicates data across multiple geographic regions. In case of a regional outage, the system can quickly failover to another region without losing access to critical customer data.</p>
<h4 id="fault-tolerance-1"><a class="header" href="#fault-tolerance-1">Fault Tolerance</a></h4>
<p>The CDP is built on a microservices architecture, where each service operates independently. If one service fails (e.g., the recommendation engine), other services (like customer segmentation) continue to function, ensuring the platform remains partially operational while the issue is addressed.</p>
<h4 id="failover-mechanisms"><a class="header" href="#failover-mechanisms">Failover Mechanisms</a></h4>
<p>The system is equipped with a failover mechanism that automatically detects service disruptions. For example, if the primary database becomes unavailable, the system seamlessly switches to a standby database, minimizing downtime.</p>
<h4 id="load-balancing"><a class="header" href="#load-balancing">Load Balancing</a></h4>
<p>Incoming data processing requests are distributed among multiple servers using a load balancer. This not only prevents any single server from being overwhelmed but also ensures that if one server goes down, the others can handle the extra load.</p>
<h4 id="regular-data-backups"><a class="header" href="#regular-data-backups">Regular Data Backups</a></h4>
<p>The system performs nightly backups of the entire CDP, including all customer data and interaction histories. These backups are stored in a secure, offsite location and can be used to restore the system in case of significant data loss.</p>
<h4 id="monitoring-and-alerts"><a class="header" href="#monitoring-and-alerts">Monitoring and Alerts</a></h4>
<p>A monitoring system tracks the health and performance of the CDP in real-time. If anomalies or performance issues are detected (e.g., a sudden drop in data ingestion rates), alerts are sent to the data reliability engineering team for immediate investigation.</p>
<h4 id="disaster-recovery-planning"><a class="header" href="#disaster-recovery-planning">Disaster Recovery Planning</a></h4>
<p>The company has a documented disaster recovery plan specifically for the CDP. This plan includes detailed procedures for restoring services in various failure scenarios, and it's regularly tested through drills to ensure the team is prepared to respond effectively to actual incidents.</p>
<p>By integrating these high availability strategies, the company ensures its customer data platform remains reliable and accessible, supporting uninterrupted marketing activities and customer interactions, even in the face of system failures or external disruptions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="antifragility"><a class="header" href="#antifragility">Antifragility</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Inspired by Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book <em>Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder</em>, antifragility differs from resilience or robustness concepts, where systems seek to maintain their reliability level. Instead, from their design, systems increase their reliability concerning the system's inputs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antifragility proposes a system design change, which are commonly designed to be fragile, meaning they will fail if operated outside their requirements. Antifragility suggests the opposite, designing systems that improve when exposed to loads outside of the requirements. In this sense, systems are not only designed to respond to the expected or anticipated but interact with their environment in real-time and adapt to it.</p>
<p>Examples of antifragile systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-healing</li>
<li>Real time sensoring, monitoring</li>
<li>Live FRACAS</li>
<li>System Health Management</li>
<li>Automatic Repair</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods such as <strong>Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Adaptation</strong> and <strong>Adaptive Load Balancing</strong> might interest data teams, but they are not covered in this book. Adaptive Load Balancing, in particular, might be a interesting topic for Data Platform or Data DevOps teams.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bulkhead-pattern"><a class="header" href="#bulkhead-pattern">Bulkhead Pattern</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>In the nautical world, we find bulkheads, wooden plates found in ships, designed to prevent the ship from sinking when a portion of the hull is compromised. The Bulkhead Pattern adapts exactly this idea, that a failure in one portion of the system should not compromise the entire system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This design pattern is commonly applied in software development, consisting of not overloading a service with more calls than it can handle at a given time, an example of this is Netflix's Hystrix system.</p>
<p>In the context of data engineering, the Bulkhead Pattern involves segmenting data processing tasks, resources, and services into isolated units so that a failure in one area does not cascade and disrupt the entire system. Here's how it could be used:</p>
<h3 id="segmenting-data-pipelines"><a class="header" href="#segmenting-data-pipelines">Segmenting Data Pipelines</a></h3>
<p>Data pipelines can be divided into independent segments or modules, each handling a specific part of the data processing workflow. If one segment encounters an issue, such as an unexpected data format or a processing error, it can be addressed or bypassed without halting the entire pipeline. This approach ensures that other data processing activities continue unaffected, maintaining overall system availability and reliability.</p>
<h3 id="isolating-services-and-resources"><a class="header" href="#isolating-services-and-resources">Isolating Services and Resources</a></h3>
<p>In a microservices architecture, each data service (e.g., data ingestion, transformation, and storage services) can be isolated, ensuring that issues in one service don't impact others. Similarly, resources like databases and compute instances can be dedicated to specific tasks or services. If one service or resource fails or becomes overloaded, it won't drag down the others, helping maintain the stability of the broader data platform.</p>
<h3 id="rate-limiting-and-throttling"><a class="header" href="#rate-limiting-and-throttling">Rate Limiting and Throttling</a></h3>
<p>Applying rate limiting to APIs and data ingestion endpoints can prevent any single user or service from consuming too many resources, which could lead to system-wide failures. By throttling the number of requests or the amount of data processed within a given timeframe, the system can remain stable even under high load, protecting against cascading failures.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-circuit-breakers"><a class="header" href="#implementing-circuit-breakers">Implementing Circuit Breakers</a></h3>
<p>Circuit breakers can temporarily halt the flow of data or requests to a service or component when a failure is detected, similar to how a bulkhead would seal off a damaged section of a ship. Once the issue is resolved, or after a certain timeout, the circuit breaker can reset, allowing the normal operation to resume. This prevents repeated failures and gives the system time to recover.</p>
<h3 id="use-of-containers-and-virtualization"><a class="header" href="#use-of-containers-and-virtualization">Use of Containers and Virtualization</a></h3>
<p>Deploying data services and applications in containers or virtualized environments can provide natural isolation, acting as bulkheads. If one containerized component fails, it can be restarted or replaced without affecting others, ensuring that the overall system remains operational.</p>
<p>By employing the Bulkhead Pattern in data engineering, organizations can build more resilient data systems that are capable of withstanding localized issues without widespread impact, ensuring continuous data processing and availability.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cold-standby"><a class="header" href="#cold-standby">Cold Standby</a></h1>
<p>Cold Standby is a redundancy technique used in data reliability engineering and system design to ensure high availability and continuity of service in the event of system failure. Unlike hot standby or warm standby, where backup systems or components are kept running or at a near-ready state, in cold standby, the backup systems are kept fully offline and are <em>only activated when the primary system fails or during maintenance periods</em>. Here’s a deeper look into cold standby:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully Offline</strong>: The standby system is not running during normal operations; it's fully powered down or in a dormant state.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Activation</strong>: Switching to the cold standby system often requires manual intervention to bring the system online, configure it, and start the services.</li>
<li><strong>Data Synchronization</strong>: Data is not continuously synchronized between the primary and cold standby systems. Instead, data is periodically backed up and would need to be restored on the cold standby system upon activation.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-Effective</strong>: Because the standby system is not running, it doesn't incur costs for power or compute resources during normal operations, making it a cost-effective solution for non-critical applications or where downtime can be tolerated for longer periods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cold standby systems are typically used in scenarios where high availability is not critically required, or the cost of maintaining a hot or warm standby system cannot be justified. Examples include non-critical batch processing systems, archival systems, or in environments where budget constraints do not allow for more sophisticated redundancy setups.</p>
<p>Implementation considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recovery Time</strong>: The time to recover services using a cold standby can be significant since the system needs to be powered up, configured, and data may need to be restored from backups. This recovery time should be considered in the system's SLA (Service Level Agreement).</li>
<li><strong>Regular Testing</strong>: Regular drills or tests should be conducted to ensure that the cold standby system can be brought online effectively and within the expected time frame.</li>
<li><strong>Data Loss Risk</strong>: Given that data synchronization is not continuous, there is a risk of data loss for transactions or data changes that occurred after the last backup. This risk needs to be assessed and mitigated through frequent backups or other means.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Processes</strong>: The need for manual intervention to activate cold standby systems requires well-documented procedures and trained personnel to ensure a smooth transition during a failure event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cold Standby is a fundamental concept in designing resilient and reliable systems, especially when balancing the need for availability with cost constraints. It provides a basic level of redundancy that can be suitable for certain applications and scenarios in data reliability engineering.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="single-point-of-failure-spof"><a class="header" href="#single-point-of-failure-spof">Single Point of Failure (SPOF)</a></h1>
<p>Eliminating Single Point of Failure (SPOF) is a critical strategy in data reliability engineering aimed at enhancing the resilience and availability of data systems. A Single Point of Failure refers to <em>any component, system, or aspect of the infrastructure whose failure would lead to the failure of the entire system</em>. This could be a database, a network component, a server, or even a piece of software that is critical to data processing or storage.</p>
<p>The goal of eliminating SPOFs is to ensure that no single failure can disrupt the entire service or data flow. This is achieved through redundancy, fault tolerance, and careful system design. Here’s how it relates to data reliability:</p>
<h3 id="redundancy-2"><a class="header" href="#redundancy-2">Redundancy</a></h3>
<p>Introducing redundancy involves duplicating critical components or services so that if one fails, the other can take over without interruption. For example, having multiple data servers, redundant network paths, or replicated databases can prevent downtime caused by the failure of any single component.</p>
<h3 id="fault-tolerance-2"><a class="header" href="#fault-tolerance-2">Fault Tolerance</a></h3>
<p>Building systems to be fault-tolerant means they can continue operating correctly even if some components fail. This might involve implementing software that can reroute data flows away from failed components or hardware that can automatically switch to backup systems.</p>
<h3 id="distributed-architectures"><a class="header" href="#distributed-architectures">Distributed Architectures</a></h3>
<p>Designing systems with distributed architectures can spread out the risk, so no single component's failure can affect the entire system. For example, using cloud services that distribute data and processing across multiple geographical locations can safeguard against regional outages.</p>
<h3 id="regular-testing"><a class="header" href="#regular-testing">Regular Testing</a></h3>
<p>Regularly testing the failover and recovery processes is essential to ensure that redundancy measures work as expected when a real failure occurs. This can include disaster recovery drills and using chaos engineering principles to intentionally introduce failures.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-monitoring-and-alerting"><a class="header" href="#continuous-monitoring-and-alerting">Continuous Monitoring and Alerting</a></h3>
<p>Implementing continuous monitoring and alerting systems helps in the early detection of potential SPOFs before they cause system-wide failures. Monitoring can identify over-utilized resources, impending hardware failures, or software errors that could become SPOFs if not addressed.</p>
<p>By eliminating Single Points of Failure, data engineering teams can create more robust and reliable systems that can withstand individual component failures without significant impact on the overall system performance or data availability. This approach is fundamental to maintaining high levels of service and ensuring that data-driven operations can proceed without interruption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>General Reliability Development Hazard Logs (GRDHL) are comprehensive records used in various engineering disciplines to <strong>identify, document, and manage potential hazards</strong> throughout the development and lifecycle of a system or product. These logs typically include details about identified hazards, their potential impact, the likelihood of occurrence, mitigation strategies, and the status of the hazard (e.g., resolved, pending review).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of data reliability engineering, adapting General Reliability Development Hazard Logs could involve creating detailed logs that specifically focus on identifying and managing risks associated with data systems and processes. This could include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Integrity Hazards</strong>: Issues that could lead to data corruption, loss, or unauthorized alteration.</li>
<li><strong>System Availability Risks</strong>: Potential system failures or downtimes that could make critical data inaccessible when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Data Quality Issues</strong>: Risks associated with inaccuracies, incompleteness, or inconsistencies in data that could compromise decision-making or operational efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong>: Hazards related to data breaches, unauthorized access, or data leaks.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance and Privacy Risks</strong>: Potential hazards related to failing to meet regulatory compliance standards or protect sensitive information.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each identified hazard, the log would document the potential impact on data reliability, measures to mitigate the risk, responsible parties for addressing the hazard, and a timeline for resolution. Regularly reviewing and updating the hazard log would be a key practice in data reliability engineering, ensuring that emerging risks are promptly identified and managed to maintain the integrity, availability, and quality of data systems.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="spare-parts-stocking-strategy"><a class="header" href="#spare-parts-stocking-strategy">Spare Parts Stocking Strategy</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Ideally, clean data sources with complex transformations and cleanings, which save time and processing and can be used in multiple stages of multiple processes, will always be available. However, they may temporarily be unavailable or fail. Once such sources are identified and found to be critical to a system or process, it is prudent to have minimal cleaning and transformation tasks that work on raw data or sources of the source. These may not result in final data with the same level of detail but will be good enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These tasks are not designed to be part of the normal process flow but are "spare parts" available for use when maintenance times are too long. The use of such tasks should be for the shortest time possible while the team has time to resolve failures in the original task or design its replacement.</p>
<p>In data engineering, a Spare Parts Stocking Strategy can be metaphorically applied to maintain high availability and reliability of data pipelines and systems. While in traditional contexts, this strategy involves keeping physical spare parts for machinery or equipment, in data engineering, it translates to having backup processes, data sources, and systems in place to ensure continuity in data operations. Here’s how it could be used:</p>
<h3 id="backup-data-processes"><a class="header" href="#backup-data-processes">Backup Data Processes</a></h3>
<p>Just as spare parts can replace failed components in machinery, backup data processes can take over when primary data processes fail. For example, if a primary ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process fails due to an issue with a data source or transformation logic, a backup ETL process can be initiated. This backup process might use a different data source or a simplified transformation logic to ensure that essential data flows continue, albeit possibly at a reduced fidelity or completeness.</p>
<h3 id="redundant-data-sources"><a class="header" href="#redundant-data-sources">Redundant Data Sources</a></h3>
<p>Having alternate data sources is akin to having spare parts for critical components. If a primary data source becomes unavailable (e.g., due to an API outage or data corruption), the data engineering process can switch to a redundant data source to minimize downtime. This ensures that data pipelines are not entirely dependent on a single source and can continue operating even when one source fails.</p>
<h3 id="pre-processed-data-reservoirs"><a class="header" href="#pre-processed-data-reservoirs">Pre-Processed Data Reservoirs</a></h3>
<p>Maintaining pre-processed versions of critical datasets can be seen as having spare parts ready to be used immediately. In case of a processing failure in real-time data pipelines, these pre-processed datasets can be quickly utilized to ensure continuity in data availability for reporting, analytics, or other downstream processes.</p>
<h3 id="simplified-or-degraded-processing-modes"><a class="header" href="#simplified-or-degraded-processing-modes">Simplified or Degraded Processing Modes</a></h3>
<p>In situations where complex data processing cannot be performed due to system failures, having a simplified or degraded mode of operation can serve as a "spare part." This approach involves having predefined, less resource-intensive processes that can provide essential functionality or data outputs until the primary systems are restored.</p>
<h3 id="automated-failover-mechanisms"><a class="header" href="#automated-failover-mechanisms">Automated Failover Mechanisms</a></h3>
<p>Automated systems that can detect failures and switch to backup processes or systems without manual intervention can be seen as having an automated spare parts deployment system. These mechanisms ensure minimal disruption to data services by quickly responding to failures.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-and-testing"><a class="header" href="#documentation-and-testing">Documentation and Testing</a></h3>
<p>Just as spare parts need to be compatible and tested for specific machinery, backup data processes and sources need to be well-documented and regularly tested to ensure they can effectively replace primary processes when needed. Regular drills or simulations of failures can help ensure that the spare processes are ready to be deployed at a moment's notice.</p>
<p>By adopting a Spare Parts Stocking Strategy in data engineering, organizations can enhance the resilience of their data infrastructure, ensuring that data processing and availability are maintained even in the face of system failures or disruptions. This strategy is crucial for businesses where data availability directly impacts decision-making, operations, and customer satisfaction.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="availability-controls"><a class="header" href="#availability-controls">Availability Controls</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Availability failures can occur for numerous reasons (from hardware to bugs), and some systems or processes are significant enough that availability controls should be implemented to ensure that certain services or data remain available when such failures occur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Availability controls range from using periodic data backups, snapshots, time travel, redundant processes, backup systems in local or cloud servers, etc.</p>
<p>Availability Controls in data engineering are mechanisms and strategies implemented to ensure that data and data processing capabilities are available when needed, particularly in the face of failures, maintenance, or unexpected demand spikes. These controls are crucial for maintaining the reliability and performance of data systems. Here's how they can be used in data engineering:</p>
<h3 id="data-backups"><a class="header" href="#data-backups">Data Backups</a></h3>
<p>Regular data backups are a fundamental availability control. By maintaining copies of critical datasets, data engineers can ensure that data can be restored in the event of corruption, accidental deletion, or data storage failures. Backups can be scheduled at regular intervals and stored in secure, geographically distributed locations to safeguard against site-specific disasters.</p>
<h3 id="redundant-data-storage"><a class="header" href="#redundant-data-storage">Redundant Data Storage</a></h3>
<p>Using redundant data storage solutions, such as RAID configurations in hardware or distributed file systems in cloud environments, can enhance data availability. These systems store copies of data across multiple disks or nodes, ensuring that the failure of a single component does not result in data loss and that data remains accessible even during partial system outages.</p>
<h3 id="high-availability-architectures"><a class="header" href="#high-availability-architectures">High Availability Architectures</a></h3>
<p>Designing data systems with high availability in mind involves deploying critical components in a redundant manner across multiple servers or clusters. This can include setting up active-active or active-passive configurations for databases, ensuring that if one instance fails, another can immediately take over without disrupting data access.</p>
<h3 id="disaster-recovery-plans"><a class="header" href="#disaster-recovery-plans">Disaster Recovery Plans</a></h3>
<p>Disaster recovery planning involves defining strategies and procedures for recovering from major incidents, such as natural disasters, cyber-attacks, or significant hardware failures. This includes not only data restoration from backups but also the rapid provisioning of replacement computing resources and network infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="load-balancing-and-scaling"><a class="header" href="#load-balancing-and-scaling">Load Balancing and Scaling</a></h3>
<p>Load balancers distribute incoming data requests across multiple servers or services, preventing any single point from becoming overwhelmed, which could lead to failures and data unavailability. Similarly, implementing auto-scaling for data processing and storage resources can ensure that the system can handle varying loads, maintaining availability during peak demand periods.</p>
<h3 id="data-quality-gates"><a class="header" href="#data-quality-gates">Data Quality Gates</a></h3>
<p>Data quality gates are checkpoints in data pipelines where data is validated against predefined quality criteria. By ensuring that only accurate and complete data moves through the system, these gates help prevent errors and inconsistencies that could lead to processing failures and data unavailability.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring-and-alerting"><a class="header" href="#monitoring-and-alerting">Monitoring and Alerting</a></h3>
<p>Continuous monitoring of data systems and pipelines allows for the early detection of issues that could impact availability. Coupled with an alerting system, monitoring ensures that data engineers can quickly respond to and address potential failures, often before they impact end-users.</p>
<h3 id="versioning-and-data-immutability"><a class="header" href="#versioning-and-data-immutability">Versioning and Data Immutability</a></h3>
<p>Implementing data versioning and immutability can prevent data loss and ensure availability in the face of changes or updates. By keeping immutable historical versions of data, systems can revert to previous states if a new data version causes issues.</p>
<p>By employing these Availability Controls, data engineers can create resilient systems that ensure continuous access to data and data processing capabilities, critical for businesses that rely on timely and reliable data for operational decision-making and customer services.</p>

<p>An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is a middleware tool designed to facilitate the integration of various applications and services across an enterprise.
In the context of data engineering, an ESB is a central hub that manages communication, data transformation, and routing between different data sources, applications, and services within an organization's IT landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Key Concepts of ESB</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration Hub</strong>: Imagine ESB as a central public transit station where different bus lines (representing various services and applications) converge. Just as passengers can transfer from one bus to another at this station to reach their destinations, data can flow between services through the ESB, enabling disparate systems to communicate effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Message-Oriented Middleware</strong>: ESB operates on a message-based system. Each piece of data, whether a request for information or the data itself, is packaged into a message. This is akin to sending parcels through a postal service with the content enclosed in packages with clear addresses.</li>
<li><strong>Data Transformation</strong>: ESB can modify the format or structure of the data messages to ensure compatibility between systems. This is similar to a translator converting a message from one language to another, ensuring that the recipient understands the message even if it originated from a system with a different data format.</li>
<li><strong>Routing</strong>: ESB routes messages between services based on predefined rules or conditions, similar to how a mail sorting center routes parcels based on their destination addresses. It can dynamically direct messages to the appropriate service based on the content of the message or other criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling</strong>: By mediating interactions between services, ESB allows systems to communicate without knowing the details of each other's operations. This decoupling is akin to making a phone call where you can communicate with someone without knowing their exact location or the technical details of the telephone network.</li>
<li><strong>Orchestration</strong>: ESB can manage complex sequences of service interactions, known as orchestrations. This is similar to conducting an orchestra, where the conductor directs various musicians (services) to play in a specific sequence to perform a symphony (a business process).</li>
<li><strong>Reliability and Fault Tolerance</strong>: ESB ensures messages are reliably delivered, even in the face of network or system failures, much like a courier service guarantees delivery of a package despite potential disruptions along the way. It can retry failed deliveries, reroute messages, or apply other strategies to ensure data reaches its intended destination.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical Use Cases in Data Engineering</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Synchronization</strong>: Ensuring consistent data across different systems, databases, and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Data Integration</strong>: Integrating streaming data from various sources for real-time analytics or operational intelligence.</li>
<li><strong>Service Orchestration</strong>: Coordinating complex data workflows that involve multiple microservices, APIs, and legacy systems.</li>
<li><strong>API Management</strong>: Facilitating secure and efficient access to data services and APIs for internal and external consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>ESBs were more prevalent in the era of SOA but are used less frequently in the microservices and cloud-native paradigms due to their centralized nature and potential for becoming bottlenecks.
Modern alternatives often focus on lighter, more decentralized approaches to integration, such as API gateways or event-driven architectures.
However, understanding ESBs can still provide valuable insights into integration patterns and principles applicable in various data engineering contexts.</p>
