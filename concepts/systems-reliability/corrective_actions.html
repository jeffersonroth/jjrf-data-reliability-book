                        <h1 id="corrective-actions"><a class="header" href="#corrective-actions">Corrective Actions</a></h1>
<p>The Corrective Actions principle involves a systematic approach to identify, analyze, and rectify faults, errors, or non-conformities in processes, systems, or products, and to implement measures to prevent their recurrence. This principle is fundamental to quality management and reliability engineering, ensuring continuous improvement and adherence to standards. It emphasizes the importance of:</p>
<p>Identification: Recognizing and documenting specific issues or failures that have occurred.
Analysis: Investigating the root causes of these issues to understand why they happened.
Rectification: Implementing solutions or changes to correct the identified issues.
Prevention: Establishing controls, processes, or systems to prevent the recurrence of similar issues in the future.</p>
<p>The Corrective Actions principle is central to maintaining the integrity, reliability, and quality of operations, products, and services, contributing to overall operational excellence and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Corrective Action and Preventive Action Process (CAPA), the Corrective Action Process (CAP), and the Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action System (FRACAS) all fall under the broad category of corrective actions principles. These methodologies share a common goal of identifying, analyzing, and rectifying issues or failures within systems, processes, or products, and implementing preventive measures to avoid recurrence. While each has its specific focus and application area, they all emphasize the importance of a structured approach to problem-solving and continuous improvement, making them integral to quality management, reliability engineering, and risk mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>A data engineer perceives corrective actions as essential processes for maintaining and enhancing the quality, reliability, and efficiency of data systems and pipelines. From the perspective of a data engineer, corrective actions involve:</p>
<p>Issue Identification: Recognizing anomalies, discrepancies, or failures in data processes, such as data pipeline failures, data quality issues, or performance bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Root Cause Analysis: Investigating the underlying causes of identified issues, employing techniques such as data lineage tracking, log analysis, and performance metrics to pinpoint the source of problems.</p>
<p>Solution Implementation: Developing and applying fixes to address the root causes, which might involve correcting data transformation logic, optimizing data models, adjusting ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs, or updating data validation rules.</p>
<p>Preventive Measures: Implementing strategies to prevent future occurrences, such as enhancing data quality checks, incorporating more robust error handling in data pipelines, or introducing automated monitoring and alerting systems.</p>
<p>Documentation and Communication: Documenting the issue, the analysis process, the implemented solution, and the preventive measures taken. Communicating these actions to relevant stakeholders, including data team members, to foster a culture of transparency and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Continuous Monitoring: Setting up ongoing monitoring of data systems to detect and address new issues promptly, ensuring that data pipelines remain reliable and performant.</p>
<p>For data engineers, the adoption of corrective actions is integral to building and managing resilient data systems that support accurate, timely, and actionable insights, thereby driving informed decision-making and strategic initiatives within the organization.</p>
<h2 id="failure-reporting-analysis-and-corrective-action-system-fracas"><a class="header" href="#failure-reporting-analysis-and-corrective-action-system-fracas">Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action System (FRACAS)</a></h2>

<li><strong>Work Order History Analysis</strong>: Analysis of the history of tickets sent to the data team.</li>
<li><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong>: Analysis of root causes.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy Adjustment</strong>: Strategy adjustment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="failure-reporting-analysis-and-corrective-action-system-fracas-implementation"><a class="header" href="#failure-reporting-analysis-and-corrective-action-system-fracas-implementation">Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action System (FRACAS) Implementation</a></h3>
<p>Implementing this process involves automating the analysis of data process logs, commits, pull requests, and tickets. In the context of data reliability engineering, implementing it involves establishing a structured approach to systematically identifying, analyzing, and resolving data-related failures.</p>
<p>Here's how it can be adapted and adopted:</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized Reporting Platform</strong>:
Implement a system to report, document, and track all identified issues. This platform should capture details about the failure, including when it occurred, its impact, and any immediate observations.</li>
<li><strong>User Reporting</strong>:
Encourage users and stakeholders to report data discrepancies or issues, providing a clear and straightforward mechanism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong>:
For each reported failure, conduct a thorough analysis to determine the underlying cause. This might involve reviewing data logs, pipeline configurations, or recent changes to the data systems.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>:
Involve cross-functional teams in the analysis to gain diverse perspectives, especially when dealing with complex data ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Corrective Actions</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Develop Solutions</strong>:
Based on the root cause analysis, develop appropriate solutions to address the identified issues. This could range from fixing data quality errors to redesigning aspects of the data pipeline for greater resilience.</li>
<li><strong>Implement Changes</strong>:
Roll out the corrective measures, ensuring that changes are tested and monitored to confirm they effectively resolve the issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Follow-Up</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>:
After implementing corrective actions, verify that the issue has been resolved and that the solution hasn't introduced new problems.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>:

<h4 id="notes-on-failure-identification-and-reporting-steps"><a class="header" href="#notes-on-failure-identification-and-reporting-steps">Notes on <em>Failure Identification</em> and <em>Reporting</em> Steps</a></h4>
<p>These steps can be done through automated monitoring tools that alert the team to issues such as failed ETL jobs, discrepancies in data validation checks, or performance bottlenecks.</p>
<h4 id="notes-on-analysis-steps"><a class="header" href="#notes-on-analysis-steps">Notes on <em>Analysis</em> Steps</a></h4>
<p>Once a failure is reported, it is analyzed to understand its nature, scope, and impact. This involves digging into logs, reviewing the data processing steps where the failure occurred, and identifying the specific point of failure. The analysis aims to classify the failure (e.g., data corruption, process failure, infrastructure issue) and understand the underlying reasons for the failure.</p>
<h4 id="notes-on-corrective-action-steps"><a class="header" href="#notes-on-corrective-action-steps">Notes on <em>Corrective Action</em> Steps</a></h4>
<p>Based on the analysis, corrective actions are determined and implemented to fix the immediate issue. This could involve rerunning a failed job with corrected parameters, fixing a bug in the data transformation logic, or updating data validation rules to catch similar issues in the future.</p>
<h4 id="notes-on-follow-up-steps"><a class="header" href="#notes-on-follow-up-steps">Notes on <em>Follow-Up</em> Steps</a></h4>
<p>All steps of the FRACAS process, from initial failure reporting to final corrective actions and system improvements, are documented. This documentation serves as a knowledge base for the data engineering team, helping them understand common failure modes, effective corrective actions, and best practices for designing more reliable data systems.</p>
<h4 id="notes-on-continuous-improvement-steps"><a class="header" href="#notes-on-continuous-improvement-steps">Notes on <em>Continuous Improvement</em> Steps</a></h4>
<p>Beyond immediate corrective actions, FRACAS also focuses on systemic improvements to prevent similar failures from occurring. This could involve redesigning parts of the data pipeline for greater resilience, adding additional checks and balances in data validation, improving data quality monitoring, or enhancing the infrastructure for better performance and reliability.</p>
<p>FRACAS is an iterative process. The learnings from each incident are fed back into the data engineering processes, leading to continuous improvement in data pipeline reliability and efficiency. Over time, this reduces the incidence of failures and improves the overall quality and trustworthiness of the data.</p>

<p>Although complete use cases will be explored in the book's next section, here's a small use case to understand the implementation and importance of FRACAS.</p>
<h4 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h4>
<p>A mature startup, "PaTech," has a complex data ecosystem with Airflow orchestrating ELT jobs via Airbyte, ETL processes through dbt models deployed in Kubernetes, and various data quality and observability tools like DataDog in place. Hundreds of engineers access the company's data lake and warehouse, while its data marts serve thousands of employees across all departments.</p>
<h4 id="challenge"><a class="header" href="#challenge">Challenge</a></h4>
<p>Despite having advanced tools and processes, DataTech Innovations faces recurring data issues affecting data quality and availability, leading to decision-making delays and decreased trust in data systems.</p>
<h4 id="fracas-implementation"><a class="header" href="#fracas-implementation">FRACAS Implementation</a></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Failure Identification</strong>:
An anomaly detected by DataDog in the data warehouse triggers an alert. The issue involves a significant discrepancy in sales data reported by the ETL process, impacting downstream data marts and reports.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Reporting</strong>:
The alert automatically generates a Jira ticket, categorizing the issue as a high-priority data quality incident. The ticket includes initial diagnostic information from DataDog and Airflow logs.</li>
<li><strong>Data Collection and Analysis</strong>:
The data reliability engineering team, using logs from Airflow and Airbyte, identifies that a recent schema change in the source CRM system wasn't reflected in the ELT job, leading to incomplete sales data extraction.</li>
<li><strong>Root Cause Analysis (RCA)</strong>:
Further investigation reveals that the change notification from the CRM team was overlooked due to a communication gap, preventing the necessary adjustments in the ELT job.</li>
<li>Corrective Actions:
<ul>
<li><strong>Immediate</strong>:
The ELT job is temporarily halted, and the schema change is manually incorporated to restore the integrity of the sales data. The corrected data is re-processed, and the affected data marts and reports are updated.</li>
<li><strong>Systemic</strong>:
The team implements a new protocol for schema change notifications, including automated alerts and a checklist in the Airflow job deployment process to verify source system schemas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Introducing automated schema detection and validation in Airbyte to flag discrepancies before data extraction.</li>
<li>Establishing a cross-functional data schema change committee to ensure all schema changes are reviewed and communicated effectively across teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Documentation and Knowledge Sharing</strong>:
The incident, RCA, corrective, and preventive measures are documented in the company's knowledge base. A company-wide presentation is conducted to share learnings, emphasizing the importance of communication and automated checks in preventing similar incidents.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Review</strong>:
DataDog alerts are fine-tuned to detect similar anomalies more effectively. The effectiveness of the new schema change protocol and automated checks are monitored over the next quarter to ensure no repeat incidents.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="outcome"><a class="header" href="#outcome">Outcome</a></h4>

<p>By applying FRACAS, data teams can move from reactive problem-solving to a proactive stance on improving data systems' reliability and efficiency, ultimately supporting better decision-making and operational performance across the organization.</p>
<h2 id="corrective-action-and-preventive-action-process-capa--corrective-action-process-cap"><a class="header" href="#corrective-action-and-preventive-action-process-capa--corrective-action-process-cap">Corrective Action and Preventive Action Process (CAPA) &amp; Corrective Action Process (CAP)</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of the Corrective Action and Preventive Action Process (CAPA), the Corrective Action Process (CAP) aims to identify failures, determine their root causes, and take corrective actions. This process also involves implementing preventive measures to avoid the recurrence of the same failure for the same reasons. You can find the complete definition in ISO 9001.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different tools and techniques are used for their application in various industries, such as PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act), DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control), 8D, etc. Typically, any tool, technique, or methodology is summarized in ISO 9001 in seven "steps":</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define the problem</strong>. This step involves confirming the problem is real and identifying the Who, What, When, Where, and Why. This step should be automated as much as possible, with the failure detected through sensors.</li>
<li><strong>Define the scope</strong>. It involves measuring the problem to be solved, knowing its frequency, which processes or tasks it affects, and which stakeholders are impacted. For data processes, many scope details should already be known from the design of the processes and tasks, and the frequency can be determined from observability and FRACAS processes.</li>
<li><strong>Containment actions</strong>. These are specific measures adopted for the shortest possible time while working on a definitive solution to the failure. Such measures should already be designed in advance for each task or sub-task. The selection of measures should be automated, or if not, they should be implemented immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Root cause identification</strong>. A clear, precise, and comprehensive failure diagnosis. Its documentation is part of the FRACAS.</li>
<li><strong>Corrective action planning</strong>. Plan corrective actions based explicitly on the root cause.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation of corrective actions</strong>. This involves the final implementation of corrective actions in the process, which should automatically be available when similar failures occur.</li>
<li><strong>Follow-up on results</strong>. Documentation, communication, complete FRACAS.</li>
</ol>
<p>Corrective Actions in data engineering involve identifying, addressing, and mitigating the root causes of identified problems within data processes and systems to prevent their recurrence. This systematic approach is crucial for maintaining the integrity, reliability, and efficiency of data operations. Here's how Corrective Actions can be applied in data engineering:</p>
<h3 id="identification-of-issues"><a class="header" href="#identification-of-issues">Identification of Issues</a></h3>
<p>The first step in the Corrective Action process is accurately identifying issues within data systems. This could range from data quality problems, pipeline failures, and performance bottlenecks to security vulnerabilities. Automated monitoring tools, data quality frameworks, and alerting systems are vital in early detection.</p>
<h3 id="root-cause-analysis-rca"><a class="header" href="#root-cause-analysis-rca">Root Cause Analysis (RCA)</a></h3>
<p>Once an issue is identified, a thorough Root Cause Analysis is conducted to understand the underlying cause of the problem. Techniques such as the Five Whys, fishbone diagrams, or Pareto analysis can be employed. For instance, if a data pipeline fails frequently due to specific data format inconsistencies, RCA would seek to uncover why these inconsistencies occur.</p>
<h3 id="planning-corrective-actions"><a class="header" href="#planning-corrective-actions">Planning Corrective Actions</a></h3>
<p>Based on the RCA findings, a corrective action plan is developed. This plan outlines the steps needed to address the root cause of the problem. In the data pipeline example, if the root cause is incorrect data formatting at the source, a corrective action could involve, for example, implementing stricter data validation checks at the data ingestion stage.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-of-corrective-actions"><a class="header" href="#implementation-of-corrective-actions">Implementation of Corrective Actions</a></h3>
<p>The planned corrective actions are then implemented. This might involve modifying data validation rules, updating ETL scripts, enhancing data quality checks, or even redesigning parts of the data pipeline for better error handling and resilience.</p>
<h3 id="verification-and-monitoring"><a class="header" href="#verification-and-monitoring">Verification and Monitoring</a></h3>
<p>After the corrective actions are implemented, verifying their effectiveness in resolving the issue and monitoring the system for unintended consequences is crucial. This could involve running test cases, monitoring data pipeline runs for a certain period, or employing data quality dashboards to ensure the issue does not recur.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-and-knowledge-sharing"><a class="header" href="#documentation-and-knowledge-sharing">Documentation and Knowledge Sharing</a></h3>
<p>All steps taken, from issue identification to implementing corrective actions and their outcomes, should be thoroughly documented. This documentation is a knowledge base for future reference and helps share learnings across the data engineering team and organization. It contributes to building a culture of continuous improvement.</p>
<h3 id="preventive-measures"><a class="header" href="#preventive-measures">Preventive Measures</a></h3>
<p>Beyond addressing the immediate issue, the insights gained during the corrective action process can inform preventive measures to avoid similar problems. This might include revising data handling policies, enhancing training for data engineers, or adopting new tools and technologies for better data management.</p>
<p>In data engineering, Corrective Actions are about fixing problems and improving processes and systems for long-term reliability and efficiency. By systematically addressing the root causes of issues, data teams can enhance the quality, security, and performance of their data infrastructure, supporting better decision-making and operational outcomes across the organization.</p>
