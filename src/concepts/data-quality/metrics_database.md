# Data Quality Metrics/Audit Database & Service
Maintaining Metrics/Audit databases and services is important for several reasons, particularly in complex data environments where ensuring data integrity, compliance, and operational efficiency is required:

### Data Integrity and Quality Assurance
Metrics and audit databases provide a systematic way to track and measure data quality, performance, and integrity over time. By maintaining these databases, organizations can identify trends, pinpoint anomalies, and take corrective actions to uphold data standards, ensuring that stakeholders can trust and rely on the data for decision-making.

### Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
Many industries are subject to strict regulatory requirements regarding data management, privacy, and security. Audit databases help in logging access, changes, and operations performed on data, which is essential for demonstrating compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, and others. They provide an immutable record that can be reviewed during audits or inspections.

### Operational Efficiency and Optimization
By analyzing metrics related to system performance, query times, resource utilization, and more, organizations can identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies within their data pipelines and infrastructure. This insight allows for targeted optimization efforts, improving overall operational efficiency and reducing costs.

### Security and Anomaly Detection
Metrics and audit logs play a critical role in security by providing detailed records of data access and system interactions. Analyzing these records helps in detecting unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats, enabling timely response and mitigation.

### Change Management and Troubleshooting
In dynamic environments where changes are frequent, maintaining a detailed record of system states, data modifications, and operational metrics is invaluable for troubleshooting issues. Audit trails and metrics allow teams to understand the impact of changes, diagnose problems, and restore system functionality more quickly.

### Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration
Metrics/Audit databases serve as a knowledge base, documenting the operational history and performance characteristics of data systems. This information can be shared across teams, improving collaboration, and enabling more informed decision-making.

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs) Monitoring
For organizations that rely on data services (either internal or external), metrics databases are essential for monitoring adherence to SLAs. They help in tracking availability, performance, and response times, ensuring that service providers meet their contractual obligations.

## Data Quality Metrics/Audit Database
Below is a conceptual example of how metrics records might be structured within a metrics database:

```sql
-- Table structure for 'data_quality_metric_records'
CREATE TABLE data_quality_metric_records (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    metric_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    metric_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    metric_formula TEXT NOT NULL,
    metric_value NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,
    source_system VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    target_system VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    data_domain VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    measurement_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    notes TEXT
);

-- Sample entries for metrics
INSERT INTO data_quality_metric_records (metric_type, metric_name, metric_formula, metric_value, source_system, target_system, data_domain, notes)
VALUES
('Completeness', 'Record Completeness', '(Number of Complete Records / Total Number of Records) * 100', 97.50, 'Postgres', 'S3', 'Sales', 'Monthly sales data completeness.'),
('Completeness', 'Field Completeness', '(Number of Fields without NULLs / Total Number of Fields) * 100', 99.30, 'Oracle', 'Redshift', 'Customer', 'Customer data fields completeness.'),
('Completeness', 'Data Mart Completeness', '(Number of Complete Data Mart Records / Total Expected Records) * 100', 98.75, 'MariaDB', 'Data Mart', 'Inventory', 'Inventory data mart completeness after dbt transformation.'),
('Completeness', 'ELT Completeness', '(Number of Records Loaded by DMS / Number of Records in Source) * 100', 99.80, 'All Sources', 'Data Lake (S3)', 'All Domains', 'Completeness of the ELT process monitored by DMS tasks.');

-- Query to retrieve the latest metrics for the 'Sales' data domain
SELECT * FROM data_quality_metric_records
WHERE data_domain = 'Sales'
ORDER BY measurement_time DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

In this example:

* `id` is a unique identifier for each metric record.
* `metric_type` describes the metric dimension (Accuracy, Completeness, etc.) being measured.
* `metric_name` describes the type of metric being measured.
* `metric_formula` provides the formula used to calculate the metric.
* `metric_value` stores the actual metric value, in this case, a percentage.
* `source_system` and `target_system` indicate where the data is coming from and where it is being loaded to.
* `data_domain` specifies the domain or category of the data being measured (e.g., sales, customer, inventory).
* `measurement_time` records the timestamp when the measurement was taken.
* `notes` is an optional field for any additional information or context about the metric.

## Data Quality Service
In a practical data environment, it's crucial to organize data quality metrics and measurement tasks into separate, well-defined tables to maintain clarity and facilitate easy data management. Here's what the structure might look like:

### `data_quality_metrics` Tables
This table would act as a reference for all defined metrics, capturing their names, formulas, and other relevant details. As a [**Type 4 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) table**](../data-architecture/slowly_changing_dimensions.md), it would maintain in one table (`data_quality_metrics_history`), a complete history of each metric (Type 2 SCD), including when they were created or if they were ever retired (`deleted_at`), and in the main table (`data_quality_metrics`), only the current metrics (Type 1 SCD).

### `data_quality_measurement_tasks` Tables
This table would contain information about the measurement tasks themselves, including the system used for measurement and the specific source and target systems involved. Like the metrics table, this would also be a type 4 SCD, preserving a historical record of measurement tasks' lifecycles (`data_quality_measurement_tasks_history`), and the current tasks (`data_quality_measurement_tasks`).

### `data_quality_metric_records` Table
Serving as the transaction table, `data_quality_metric_records` would hold the actual records of measurements. Each record would reference the relevant metric (`data_quality_metrics.id`) and measurement task (`data_quality_measurement_tasks`), along with the unique identifier for the run (`run_id`), and a URL pointing to the relevant logs for that run (`run_url`).

### Data Quality Service
The setup would be supported by a dedicated service, tentatively named `data-quality-service`, which would facilitate the recording of measurement data, potentially through an API. The management of `data_quality_metrics` and `data_quality_measurement_tasks` through their APIs, while not detailed in this example, would be a critical part of the overall data quality infrastructure.

By segregating metric definitions, measurement tasks, and actual measurement records into distinct tables and managing them through a dedicated service, organizations can ensure that data quality tracking is both efficient and scalable. This approach allows for the precise pinpointing of data quality issues and facilitates a structured way to track improvements and changes over time.

## Taking Action
In a practical setup, it's crucial to not only collect data quality metrics but also to analyze, monitor, and act upon them effectively. Integrating observability tools, automating ticketing systems, utilizing data visualization platforms, leveraging communication systems, and disseminating reports are key to maintaining high data quality standards:

### Observability Tools (e.g., DataDog)
Configure DataDog to monitor `data_quality_metric_records` for significant deviations or trends in data quality metrics.

Set up alerts in DataDog for when metrics fall below predefined thresholds, indicating potential data quality issues.

### Ticket Automation (e.g., Jira)
Automate the creation of Jira tickets through API integration when DataDog alerts trigger, ensuring immediate action on data quality issues.

Include relevant details in the ticket, such as `metric_name`, `metric_value`, `run_url`, and a brief description of the potential issue for quicker resolution.

### Data Visualization Dashboards (e.g., Tableau, PowerBI)
Develop dashboards in Tableau or PowerBI that visualize key data quality metrics over time, providing a clear view of data quality trends and anomalies.

Enable dashboard filters by `source_system`, `target_system`, and `data_domain` for targeted analysis by different teams.

### Communication Systems (e.g., Slack, Teams)
Set up integrations with Slack or Teams to send automated notifications about critical data quality alerts, ensuring broad awareness among relevant stakeholders.

Create dedicated channels for data quality discussions, facilitating collaborative problem-solving and updates on issue resolution.

### Reports (e.g., SharePoint)
Regularly generate comprehensive data quality reports that summarize the state of data quality across different domains and systems, making them accessible on SharePoint for wider organizational visibility.

Include insights, trend analyses, and recommendations for improvements in the reports to guide strategic data quality initiatives.

By employing this multifaceted approach, organizations can ensure that data quality metrics are not only tracked but also analyzed and acted upon promptly. This proactive stance on data quality management enables quicker identification and resolution of issues, maintains trust in data systems, and supports informed decision-making across the organization.
