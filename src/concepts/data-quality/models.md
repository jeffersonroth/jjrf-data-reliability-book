# Data Quality Models
>
> Data Quality Models are fundamental frameworks that define, measure, and evaluate the quality of data within an organization. These models are crucial because they provide a structured approach to identifying and quantifying the various aspects of data quality, which are essential for ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, reliable, and fit for its intended use.

Data Quality Models are particularly important for data teams, data engineers, and data analysts who are responsible for managing the lifecycle of data, from its creation and storage to its processing and analysis. By applying these models, professionals can ensure that the data they work with meets the necessary standards of quality, thereby supporting effective decision-making, optimizing business processes, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

A Data Quality Model is a conceptual framework used to define, understand, and measure the quality of data. It outlines specific criteria and dimensions that are essential for assessing the fitness of data for its intended use. These models serve as a guideline for data teams, including data engineers and data analysts, to systematically evaluate and improve the quality of the data within their systems.

## Key Criteria and Dimensions of Data Quality

Data quality can be assessed through various dimensions, each representing a critical aspect of the data's overall quality. While different models may emphasize different dimensions, the following are widely recognized and form the core of most Data Quality Models:

* [**Accuracy**](./accuracy_dimension.md): Refers to the correctness and precision of the data. Data is considered accurate if it correctly represents the real-world values it is intended to model.
* [**Completeness**](./completeness_dimension.md): Measures whether all the required data is present. Incomplete data can lead to gaps in analysis and decision-making.
* [**Consistency**](./consistency_dimension.md): Ensures that the data does not contain conflicting or contradictory information across the dataset or between multiple data sources.
* [**Timeliness**](./timeliness_dimension.md): Pertains to the availability of data when it is needed. Timely data is crucial for decision-making processes that rely on up-to-date information.
* [**Relevance**](./relevance_dimension.md): Assesses whether the data is applicable and helpful for the context in which it is used. Data should meet the needs of its intended purpose.
* [**Reliability**](./reliability_dimension.md): Focuses on the trustworthiness of the data. Reliable data is sourced from credible sources and maintained through dependable processes.
* [**Uniqueness**](./uniqueness_dimension.md): Ensures that entities within the data are represented only once. Duplicate records can skew analysis and lead to inaccurate conclusions.
* [**Validity**](./validity_dimension.md): Measures whether the data conforms to the specific syntax (format, type, range) defined by the data model and business rules.
* [**Accessibility**](./accessibility_dimension.md): Data should be easily retrievable and usable by authorized individuals, ensuring that data consumers can access the data when needed.
* [**Integrity**](./integrity_dimension.md): Refers to the maintenance of data consistency and accuracy over its lifecycle, including relationships within the data that enforce logical rules and constraints.

## Applying a Data Quality Model

In practice, data teams apply these dimensions by:

* **Setting Benchmarks**: Defining acceptable levels or thresholds for each data quality dimension relevant to their business context.
* **Data Profiling and Auditing**: Using tools and techniques to assess the current state of data against the defined benchmarks.
* **Implementing Controls**: Establishing processes and controls to maintain data quality, such as validation checks during data entry or automated cleansing routines.
* **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitoring data quality metrics to identify areas for improvement and to ensure ongoing compliance with quality standards.

## Impact on Data Infrastructure

The application of a Data Quality Model has a direct impact on the design and architecture of data infrastructure:

* **Data Warehouses and Data Lakes**: Ensuring that data stored in these repositories meets quality standards is crucial for reliable reporting and analytics.
* **Data Marts**: Tailored for specific business functions, the quality of data in data marts directly affects the accuracy and reliability of business insights derived from them.
* **ETL Processes**: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes must incorporate data quality checks to cleanse, validate, and standardize data as it moves between systems.

## Scope

Before delving into the specific dimensions of data quality, it's important to outline the components of the data infrastructure ecosystem that will be under consideration:

* **Data Source (Operational Data)**: This refers to the original data sources that feed into data lakes, data warehouses, and data marts. It's primarily operational data that originates from business activities and transactions.
* **ELTs (Extract, Load, Transform)**: These are the processes responsible for ingesting Operational Data into the data infrastructure, which could be a database, a data lake, or a data warehouse. Tools like AWS DMS (Database Migration Service), Airbyte, Fivetran, or services connecting to data sources through APIs, ODBC, message queues, etc.
* **Data Lake**: This component acts as a vast repository for storing a wide array of data types, including Structured, Semi-Structured, and Unstructured data. An example of a data lake is AWS S3 Buckets.
* **Data Warehouse**: Serving as a centralized repository, a data warehouse enables the analysis of data to support informed decision-making. Some examples include Snowflake, AWS Redshift, and Databricks Data Lakehouse.
* **Data Marts**: These are focused segments of data warehouses tailored to meet the specific requirements of different business units or departments, facilitating more targeted data analysis.
* **ETLs (Extract, Transform, Load)**: This process is centered around data transformation. Tools such as dbt, pandas, and Informatica are commonly used for this purpose.

Depending on the use case, the presence and significance of these components may vary. Similarly, the dimensions of data quality being assessed might also differ based on the specific requirements and context of each scenario.

## Data Quality Metrics/Audit Database & Service

Maintaining [Data Quality Metrics/Audit databases and services](./metrics_database.md) is foundational to managing modern data ecosystems effectively. They provide the visibility, accountability, and insights necessary to ensure data reliability, optimize operations, maintain compliance, and secure data assets, ultimately supporting the organization's strategic objectives.
