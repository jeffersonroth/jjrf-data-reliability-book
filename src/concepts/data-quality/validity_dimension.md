# Validity Dimension in Data Quality
> Validity in data quality refers to the degree to which data conforms to specific syntax (format, type, range) and semantic (meaningful and appropriate content) rules defined by the data model and business requirements. Valid data adheres to predefined formats, standards, and constraints, ensuring that it is both structurally sound and contextually meaningful for its intended use.

Assessing validity involves checking data against established rules and constraints to ensure it meets the required standards for format, type, range, and content. Here's how validity can be evaluated across different stages of the data infrastructure:

## Data Sources (Operational Data)
* **Metric**: Format Conformance Rate
  * **Formula**: \\( Format \ Conformance \ Rate = \frac{Number\ of \ Records \ Meeting \ Format \ Specifications}{Total \ Number \ of \ Records} \times 100 \\)
  * **Application**: Analyze operational data to ensure that it conforms to expected formats (e.g., date formats, postal codes). This can be done using SQL queries or data profiling tools to check data formats against predefined patterns.

## Data Lakes and Data Warehouses
* **Metric**: Data Type Integrity Score
  * **Formula**: \\( Data \ Type \ Integrity \ Rate = \frac{Number \ of \ Records \ with \ Correct \ Data \ Types}{Total \ Number \ of \ Records} \times 100 \\)
  * **Application**: In data lakes and warehouses, assess the integrity of data types to ensure that data is stored in the correct format (e.g., numeric fields are stored as numbers). Automated data quality tools can scan datasets to identify type mismatches.

## Data Marts
* **Metric**: Business Rule Compliance Rate
  * **Formula**: \\( Business \ Rule \ Compliance \ Rate = \frac{Number \ of \ Records \ Complying \ with \ Business \ Rules}{Total \ Number \ of \ Records} \times 100 \\)
  * **Application**: For data marts, ensure that data complies with specific business rules relevant to the department or function. This involves setting up rule-based validation checks that can be run on the data mart contents.

## Reports and Dashboards
* **Metric**: Content Validity Check
  * **Formula**: Qualitative assessment based on user feedback and automated validation checks.
  * **Application**: Ensure that reports and dashboards contain valid data by implementing content validity checks, which might include verifying that displayed data falls within expected ranges or adheres to specific content rules.

## Ensuring and Improving Validity
Strategies to maintain and enhance data validity across the data infrastructure include:

* **Validation Rules and Constraints**: Implement comprehensive validation rules and constraints at the point of data entry and throughout data processing pipelines to ensure data validity.
* **Data Quality Tools**: Utilize data quality tools that offer automated validation capabilities, allowing for the continuous checking of data against validity rules.
* **Data Cleansing**: Engage in regular data cleansing activities to correct invalid data, using scripts or data quality platforms to identify and rectify issues.
* **Metadata Management**: Maintain detailed metadata that specifies the valid format, type, and constraints for each data element, guiding data handling and validation processes.
* **User Education and Guidelines**: Educate users involved in data entry and management about the importance of data validity and provide clear guidelines and training on maintaining it.
