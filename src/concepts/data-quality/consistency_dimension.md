# Consistency Dimension in Data Quality
>
> Consistency in data quality refers to the absence of discrepancy and contradiction in the data across different datasets, systems, or time periods. It ensures that data remains uniform, coherent, and aligned with predefined rules or formats across the entire data infrastructure, minimizing conflicts and errors that can arise from inconsistent data.

## Consistency Metrics

To evaluate consistency, data teams apply specific metrics that help identify discrepancies within and across datasets. Here's how consistency can be assessed at various stages of the data infrastructure:

### Data Sources (Operational Data)

* **Cross-System Data Validation**:
  Compare data values and formats across different operational databases (like Postgres, Oracle, and MariaDB) to ensure they follow the same standards and rules.

* **Reference Data Consistency**:
  Ensure that reference data (e.g. country codes, product categories) used across multiple systems is consistent and up-to-date.

#### Example: Cross-System Consistency Rate

\\[ Consistency \ Ratio = \frac{Number\ of \ Consistent \ Records \ Across \ Systems}{Total \ Number \ of \ Compared \ Records} \times 100 \\]

**Application**: Compare key data elements (e.g., customer information, and product details) across different operational systems to identify inconsistencies. SQL queries or data comparison tools can facilitate this process.

### ELT Processes

* **Schema Consistency Checks**:
  During ELT processes, especially with tools like AWS DMS, validate that the applied schema transformations maintain consistency in data types, formats, and naming conventions across source and target systems.

* **Data Transformation Logic Validation**:
  Verify that the transformation logic in ELT does not introduce inconsistencies, especially when aggregating or modifying data.

#### Example: Transformation Consistency Check

**Application**: Consists of implementing automated checks or tests within ELT pipelines to ensure that loaded data maintains data integrity. There is no fixed formula; it involves verifying that data transformations produce consistent results across different batches or datasets.

### Data Lakes and Data Warehouses

* **Historical Data Alignment**:
  Check that historical data loaded into data lakes or warehouses remains consistent with current operational data in terms of structure, format, and content.

* **Dimension Table Consistency**:
  In data warehousing, ensure that dimension tables (like customer or product dimensions) maintain consistent attribute values over time, even as new data is integrated.

#### Example: Historical Data Consistency

\\[ Historical \ Consistency \ Rate = \frac{Number\ of \ Records \ Matching \ Historical \ Patterns}{Total \ Number \ of \ Records} \times 100 \\]

**Application**: Analyze time-series data or historical records within the data lake or warehouse to ensure that data remains consistent over time. This may involve trend analysis or anomaly detection techniques.

### Data Marts

* **Report Data Consistency**:
  Validate that the data used in different data marts for reporting purposes remains consistent, providing a unified view to end-users.

* **Metric Definitions Alignment**:
  Ensure that business metrics calculated across various data marts adhere to a single definition to prevent discrepancies in reports.

#### Example: Dimensional Consistency

\\[ Dimensional \ Consistency \ Rate = \frac{Number\ of \ Consistent \ Dimension \ Records}{Total \ Number \ of \ Dimension \ Records} \times 100 \\]

**Application**: Assess the consistency of dimension tables (e.g., time dimensions, geographical hierarchies) to ensure they align with business rules and definitions.

## Ensuring and Improving Consistency

Strategies to maintain and enhance data consistency across the data infrastructure include:

* **Standardization**:
  Develop and enforce data standards and conventions across the organization to ensure consistency in data entry, formatting, and processing.

* **Centralized Data Catalogs**:
  Maintain centralized data catalogs or dictionaries that define data elements, their acceptable values, and formats to guide consistent data usage.

* **Automated Validation**:
  Incorporate automated validation rules and checks in data pipelines to detect and correct inconsistencies as data moves through ELT processes.

* **Master Data Management (MDM)**:
  Implement MDM practices to manage key data entities centrally, ensuring consistent reference data across systems.

* **Data Reconciliation**:
  Regularly perform data reconciliation exercises to align data across different systems, particularly after significant data migrations or integrations.

Maintaining data consistency is crucial for ensuring that analyses, reports, and business decisions based on the data are accurate and reliable. It reduces confusion, increases trust in data systems, and enhances the overall quality of data available to stakeholders.
