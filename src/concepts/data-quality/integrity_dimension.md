# Integrity Dimension in Data Quality
> Integrity in data quality refers to the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data across its lifecycle. It involves maintaining data's completeness, coherence, and credibility, ensuring that it remains unaltered from its source through various transformations and usage. Data integrity is crucial for ensuring that the information used for decision-making, reporting, and analysis is reliable and reflects the true state of affairs.

## Integrity Metrics
Evaluating data integrity involves assessing the processes, controls, and systems in place to prevent unauthorized data alteration and to ensure data remains consistent and accurate. Hereâ€™s how integrity can be assessed across different stages of the data infrastructure:

### Data Sources (Operational Data) - Source-to-Target Consistency Rate
\\[ Source-to-Target \ Consistency \ Rate = \frac{Number\ of \ Consistent \ Records \ Between \ Source \ and \ Target}{Total \ Number \ of \ Records \ Reviewed} \times 100 \\]

**Application**: Compare data records in the operational systems (source) with those in the data warehouse or lake (target) to ensure data has been transferred accurately and remains unaltered.

### Data Lakes and Data Warehouses - Referential Integrity Score
\\[ Referential \ Integrity \ Score = \frac{Number \ of \ Records \ with \ Valid \ References}{Total \ Number \ of \ Records} \times 100 \\]

**Application**: Validate referential integrity within the data lake or warehouse, ensuring that all foreign key relationships are consistent and that related records are present.

### Data Marts - Dimensional Integrity Index
\\[ Dimensional \ Integrity \ Index = \frac{Number \ of \ Dimension \ Records \ with \ Consistent \ Attributes}{Total \ Number \ of \ Dimension \ Records} \times 100 \\]

**Application**: Check the integrity of dimension tables in data marts, ensuring that attributes like time dimensions, geographical hierarchies, or product categories remain consistent and accurate.

### Reports and Dashboards - Data Traceability Index
**Application**: Ensure that data presented in reports and dashboards can be traced back to its original source or the transformation logic applied, maintaining a clear lineage for auditability and verification. It is a qualitative assessment based on the ability to trace data back to its source.

## Ensuring and Improving Integrity
To maintain and enhance data integrity across the data infrastructure, consider implementing the following strategies:

* **Data Validation Rules**:
  Establish validation rules that check data for integrity at every stage of its movement and transformation within the system.

* **Audit Trails and Data Lineage**:
  Maintain comprehensive audit trails and clear data lineage documentation, enabling the tracking of data from its source through all transformations to its final form.

* **Access Controls and Security Measures**:
  Implement robust access controls and security measures to prevent unauthorized data access or alteration, protecting data integrity.

* **Regular Data Audits**:
  Conduct periodic audits of data and data management processes to identify and rectify any integrity issues, ensuring ongoing compliance with data integrity standards.

* **Error Handling and Correction Procedures**:
  Develop standardized procedures for handling data errors and anomalies detected during processing, ensuring that integrity issues are promptly and effectively addressed.

## Integrity Metrics Examples
Here are some examples of integrity metrics that can be applied in various business contexts:

### Data Lineage Traceability Score
**Application**: Measure the percentage of data elements within a dataset for which complete lineage (origin, transformations, and current state) can be accurately traced, ensuring transparency and accountability in data handling.

### Cross-System Data Consistency Rate
**Application**: Evaluate the level of consistency for the same data elements stored across different systems or databases, ensuring data remains unaltered and reliable across platforms.

### Data Transformation Integrity Score
**Application**: Assess the accuracy and correctness of data transformations applied during ETL processes, maintaining the integrity of data as it is processed and stored.

### Referential Integrity Compliance Rate
Formula: 
**Application**: Measure the degree to which databases maintain referential integrity by ensuring that all foreign key values have a corresponding primary key value in the related table, preserving data relationships and coherence.

### Audit Trail Coverage Rate
**Application**: Quantify the proportion of data transactions or modifications that have a complete, unbroken audit trail, allowing for full accountability and traceability of data changes.

By monitoring these metrics, organizations can ensure that their data maintains high integrity throughout its lifecycle, from creation and storage to transformation and usage. This is crucial for relying on data for critical business decisions, regulatory compliance, and maintaining trust with stakeholders. Setting up alerts for deviations in these metrics can help in quickly identifying and addressing issues that may compromise data integrity.
