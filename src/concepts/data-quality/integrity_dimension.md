# Integrity Dimension in Data Quality
> Integrity in data quality refers to the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data across its lifecycle. It involves maintaining data's completeness, coherence, and credibility, ensuring that it remains unaltered from its source through various transformations and usage. Data integrity is crucial for ensuring that the information used for decision-making, reporting, and analysis is reliable and reflects the true state of affairs.

Evaluating data integrity involves assessing the processes, controls, and systems in place to prevent unauthorized data alteration and to ensure data remains consistent and accurate. Hereâ€™s how integrity can be assessed across different stages of the data infrastructure:

## Data Sources (Operational Data)
* **Metric**: Source-to-Target Consistency Rate
  * **Formula**: \\( Source-to-Target \ Consistency \ Rate = \frac{Number\ of \ Consistent \ Records \ Between \ Source \ and \ Target}{Total \ Number \ of \ Records \ Reviewed} \times 100 \\)
  * **Application**: Compare data records in the operational systems (source) with those in the data warehouse or lake (target) to ensure data has been transferred accurately and remains unaltered.

## Data Lakes and Data Warehouses
* **Metric**: Referential Integrity Score
  * **Formula**: \\( Referential \ Integrity \ Score = \frac{Number \ of \ Records \ with \ Valid \ References}{Total \ Number \ of \ Records} \times 100 \\)
  * **Application**: Validate referential integrity within the data lake or warehouse, ensuring that all foreign key relationships are consistent and that related records are present.

## Data Marts
* **Metric**: Dimensional Integrity Index
  * **Formula**: \\( Dimensional \ Integrity \ Index = \frac{Number \ of \ Dimension \ Records \ with \ Consistent \ Attributes}{Total \ Number \ of \ Dimension \ Records} \times 100 \\)
  * **Application**: Check the integrity of dimension tables in data marts, ensuring that attributes like time dimensions, geographical hierarchies, or product categories remain consistent and accurate.

## Reports and Dashboards
* **Metric**: Data Traceability Index
  * **Formula**: Qualitative assessment based on the ability to trace data back to its source.
  * **Application**: Ensure that data presented in reports and dashboards can be traced back to its original source or the transformation logic applied, maintaining a clear lineage for auditability and verification.

## Ensuring and Improving Integrity
To maintain and enhance data integrity across the data infrastructure, consider implementing the following strategies:

* **Data Validation Rules**: Establish validation rules that check data for integrity at every stage of its movement and transformation within the system.
* **Audit Trails and Data Lineage**: Maintain comprehensive audit trails and clear data lineage documentation, enabling the tracking of data from its source through all transformations to its final form.
* **Access Controls and Security Measures**: Implement robust access controls and security measures to prevent unauthorized data access or alteration, protecting data integrity.
* **Regular Data Audits**: Conduct periodic audits of data and data management processes to identify and rectify any integrity issues, ensuring ongoing compliance with data integrity standards.
* **Error Handling and Correction Procedures**: Develop standardized procedures for handling data errors and anomalies detected during processing, ensuring that integrity issues are promptly and effectively addressed.
