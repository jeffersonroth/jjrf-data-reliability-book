# Introduction to Systems
> In the context of data reliability, a system can be defined as a collection of interrelated components working together towards a common goal, often to process, store, and manage data. These components can include hardware, software, databases, procedures, and people, all interacting in a structured way to achieve efficient and reliable data handling.

For people interested in studying data reliability, it's important to understand a system from both a **technical** and **operational perspective**. Technically, a system would include the architecture, technology, and protocols that ensure data integrity, availability, and consistency. Operationally, it involves the procedures and practices that maintain the system's performance and reliability over time.

In essence, when talking about data reliability, a system can be thought of as the entire ecosystem that supports the lifecycle of data, from its creation and storage to its retrieval and usage. This includes considerations of redundancy, fault tolerance, backup procedures, security measures, and regular maintenance practices, all of which contribute to the system's overall reliability and the trustworthiness of the service it provides.
