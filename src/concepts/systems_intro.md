# Introduction to Systems

```admonish tip title="Defining Systems"
This book defines a system as a *complex arrangement of interconnected components, including hardware, software, databases, procedures, and people, that work together towards a common goal*. This goal is often to process, store, and manage data efficiently and reliably.

Technically, a system includes the architecture, technology, and protocols in place to ensure data integrity, availability, and consistency. Operationally, it entails the procedures and practices employed to maintain the system's performance and reliability over time.

When discussing data reliability engineering, a system encompasses the entire ecosystem that supports the data lifecycle, which includes data creation, storage, retrieval, and usage. A comprehensive system considers redundancy, fault tolerance, backup procedures, security measures, and regular maintenance practices. All of these elements contribute to the overall reliability of the system and the trustworthiness of its service.
