Together, these tools form a foundational component of a data quality framework, automating critical quality assurance tasks to secure data reliability and trustworthiness.
```

```admonish list title="Version Control Systems"
[Version Control Systems (VCS)](./version_control_systems.md) are indispensable in managing changes to code, configurations, and data models, ensuring consistency and facilitating collaboration across data teams. Among various systems, Git-based solutions like GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket are widely adopted for their robustness, flexibility, and community support.

Data teams leverage these platforms for more than just code; they're used to version control data schemas, transformation scripts, and even some tiny data sets, ensuring that every aspect of data processing can be tracked, reviewed, and rolled back if necessary. This practice enhances reproducibility, accountability, and collaboration, allowing teams to work on complex data projects with greater confidence and efficiency.

Integrating CI/CD pipelines within these platforms further automates data pipeline testing, deployment, and monitoring, aligning data operations with best practices in software development and making the entire data lifecycle more reliable and streamlined.
```

```admonish list title="Metadata Management and Data Lineage Tools"
[Metadata Management and Data Lineage Tools](./data_lineage_tools.md) are central to understanding and managing the lifecycle and lineage of data within systems.
These tools provide visibility into data origin, transformation, and consumption, facilitating greater transparency, compliance, and data governance.

Apache Atlas, Datahub, and Amundsen stand out in this space for their comprehensive approach to metadata management and data lineage tracking.
They offer rich features to catalog data assets, capture lineage, and provide a searchable interface for data discovery, making it easier for teams to understand data dependencies and the impact of changes and ensure data quality across pipelines.

While primarily for transformation, dbt aids in data lineage by documenting models and visualizing data flow, especially within Data Marts.
However, its scope is less extensive in the broader Data Warehouse, as dbt is more tailored to Data Mart-specific transformations.
```

```admonish list title="Metadata Management and Data Lineage Tools"
[Workflow Orchestration Tools](./workflow_orchestration_tools.md) serve as the backbone of data teams, particularly in data engineering, by coordinating complex data workflows, automating tasks, and managing dependencies across various tools and systems.
