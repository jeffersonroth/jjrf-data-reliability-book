# Bulkhead Pattern
>
> In the nautical world, we find bulkheads, wooden plates found in ships, designed to prevent the ship from sinking when a portion of the hull is compromised. The Bulkhead Pattern adapts exactly this idea, that a failure in one portion of the system should not compromise the entire system.

This design pattern is commonly applied in software development, consisting of not overloading a service with more calls than it can handle at a given time, an example of this is Netflix's Hystrix system.

In the context of data engineering, the Bulkhead Pattern involves segmenting data processing tasks, resources, and services into isolated units so that a failure in one area does not cascade and disrupt the entire system. Here's how it could be used:

### Segmenting Data Pipelines

Data pipelines can be divided into independent segments or modules, each handling a specific part of the data processing workflow. If one segment encounters an issue, such as an unexpected data format or a processing error, it can be addressed or bypassed without halting the entire pipeline. This approach ensures that other data processing activities continue unaffected, maintaining overall system availability and reliability.

### Isolating Services and Resources

In a microservices architecture, each data service (e.g., data ingestion, transformation, and storage services) can be isolated, ensuring that issues in one service don't impact others. Similarly, resources like databases and compute instances can be dedicated to specific tasks or services. If one service or resource fails or becomes overloaded, it won't drag down the others, helping maintain the stability of the broader data platform.

### Rate Limiting and Throttling

Applying rate limiting to APIs and data ingestion endpoints can prevent any single user or service from consuming too many resources, which could lead to system-wide failures. By throttling the number of requests or the amount of data processed within a given timeframe, the system can remain stable even under high load, protecting against cascading failures.

### Implementing Circuit Breakers

Circuit breakers can temporarily halt the flow of data or requests to a service or component when a failure is detected, similar to how a bulkhead would seal off a damaged section of a ship. Once the issue is resolved, or after a certain timeout, the circuit breaker can reset, allowing the normal operation to resume. This prevents repeated failures and gives the system time to recover.

### Use of Containers and Virtualization

Deploying data services and applications in containers or virtualized environments can provide natural isolation, acting as bulkheads. If one containerized component fails, it can be restarted or replaced without affecting others, ensuring that the overall system remains operational.

By employing the Bulkhead Pattern in data engineering, organizations can build more resilient data systems that are capable of withstanding localized issues without widespread impact, ensuring continuous data processing and availability.
