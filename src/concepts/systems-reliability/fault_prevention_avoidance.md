# Fault Prevention: Avoidance
There are two phases in fault prevention: **avoidance** and **elimination**.

> Avoidance aims to limit the introduction of potentially defective data and objects during the execution of the process.

Such as:
* The use of validated and clean information sources, when possible.
* The implementation of data cleaning and validation processes for raw data.
* The validation of table and column availability within databases.
* The introduction of branch operators for effective data management.
* Implementing rigorous code review processes to maintain a clean and secure codebase.
* Adopting standardized coding practices and safe coding guidelines to minimize errors and security vulnerabilities.
* The utilization of automated testing frameworks for continuous testing (unit, integration, system) throughout the development cycle.
* Configuration management tools and practices are applied to oversee changes in software and hardware, ensuring all modifications are authorized and tested.
* The engagement in detailed requirement analysis and system design reviews to affirm the system's resilience against potential faults, including modeling and simulation tools.
* Incorporating fail-safe and fail-soft designs to maintain system safety in case of failure, including redundancy strategies for critical components.
