# Spare Parts Stocking Strategy
>
> Ideally, clean data sources with complex transformations and cleanings, which save time and processing and can be used in multiple stages of multiple processes, will always be available. However, they may temporarily be unavailable or fail. Once such sources are identified and found to be critical to a system or process, it is prudent to have minimal cleaning and transformation tasks that work on raw data or sources of the source. These may not result in final data with the same level of detail but will be good enough.

These tasks are not designed to be part of the normal process flow but are "spare parts" available for use when maintenance times are too long. The use of such tasks should be for the shortest time possible while the team has time to resolve failures in the original task or design its replacement.

In data engineering, a Spare Parts Stocking Strategy can be metaphorically applied to maintain high availability and reliability of data pipelines and systems. While in traditional contexts, this strategy involves keeping physical spare parts for machinery or equipment, in data engineering, it translates to having backup processes, data sources, and systems in place to ensure continuity in data operations. Hereâ€™s how it could be used:

### Backup Data Processes

Just as spare parts can replace failed components in machinery, backup data processes can take over when primary data processes fail. For example, if a primary ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process fails due to an issue with a data source or transformation logic, a backup ETL process can be initiated. This backup process might use a different data source or a simplified transformation logic to ensure that essential data flows continue, albeit possibly at a reduced fidelity or completeness.

### Redundant Data Sources

Having alternate data sources is akin to having spare parts for critical components. If a primary data source becomes unavailable (e.g., due to an API outage or data corruption), the data engineering process can switch to a redundant data source to minimize downtime. This ensures that data pipelines are not entirely dependent on a single source and can continue operating even when one source fails.

### Pre-Processed Data Reservoirs

Maintaining pre-processed versions of critical datasets can be seen as having spare parts ready to be used immediately. In case of a processing failure in real-time data pipelines, these pre-processed datasets can be quickly utilized to ensure continuity in data availability for reporting, analytics, or other downstream processes.

### Simplified or Degraded Processing Modes

In situations where complex data processing cannot be performed due to system failures, having a simplified or degraded mode of operation can serve as a "spare part." This approach involves having predefined, less resource-intensive processes that can provide essential functionality or data outputs until the primary systems are restored.

### Automated Failover Mechanisms

Automated systems that can detect failures and switch to backup processes or systems without manual intervention can be seen as having an automated spare parts deployment system. These mechanisms ensure minimal disruption to data services by quickly responding to failures.

### Documentation and Testing

Just as spare parts need to be compatible and tested for specific machinery, backup data processes and sources need to be well-documented and regularly tested to ensure they can effectively replace primary processes when needed. Regular drills or simulations of failures can help ensure that the spare processes are ready to be deployed at a moment's notice.

By adopting a Spare Parts Stocking Strategy in data engineering, organizations can enhance the resilience of their data infrastructure, ensuring that data processing and availability are maintained even in the face of system failures or disruptions. This strategy is crucial for businesses where data availability directly impacts decision-making, operations, and customer satisfaction.
