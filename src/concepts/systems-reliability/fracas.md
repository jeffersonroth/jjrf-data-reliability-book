# Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action System (FRACAS)
> FRACAS is a defined system or process for reporting, classifying, and analyzing failures, as well as planning corrective actions for such failures. It is part of the process to keep a history of analyses and actions taken.

Implementing this process involves automating the analysis of data process logs, commits, pull requests, and tickets.

The FRACAS process is cyclical and follows the adapted FRACAS Kaizen Loop:
* **Failure Mode Analysis**: Analysis of failure modes.
* **Failure Codes Creation**: Creation of failure codes or the methodology for classifying them.
* **Work Order History Analysis**: Analysis of the history of tickets sent to the data team.
* **Root Cause Analysis**: Analysis of root causes.
* **Strategy Adjustment**: Strategy adjustment.

Here's how FRACAS could be applied in the context of data engineering:

### Failure Reporting
Data engineers and stakeholders report failures or anomalies detected in data processing tasks, data quality issues, or any incidents that affect the expected outcomes of data pipelines. This can be done through automated monitoring tools that alert the team to issues such as failed ETL jobs, discrepancies in data validation checks, or performance bottlenecks.

### Analysis
Once a failure is reported, it is analyzed to understand its nature, scope, and impact. This involves digging into logs, reviewing the data processing steps where the failure occurred, and identifying the specific point of failure. The analysis aims to classify the failure (e.g., data corruption, process failure, infrastructure issue) and understand the underlying reasons for the failure.

### Corrective Action
Based on the analysis, corrective actions are determined and implemented to fix the immediate issue. This could involve rerunning a failed job with corrected parameters, fixing a bug in the data transformation logic, or updating data validation rules to catch similar issues in the future.

### System Improvement
Beyond immediate corrective actions, FRACAS also focuses on systemic improvements to prevent similar failures from occurring. This could involve redesigning parts of the data pipeline for greater resilience, adding additional checks and balances in data validation, improving data quality monitoring, or enhancing the infrastructure for better performance and reliability.

### Documentation and Learning
All steps of the FRACAS process, from initial failure reporting to final corrective actions and system improvements, are documented. This documentation serves as a knowledge base for the data engineering team, helping them understand common failure modes, effective corrective actions, and best practices for designing more reliable data systems.

### Continuous Improvement
FRACAS is an iterative process. The learnings from each incident are fed back into the data engineering processes, leading to continuous improvement in data pipeline reliability and efficiency. Over time, this reduces the incidence of failures and improves the overall quality and trustworthiness of the data.

By applying FRACAS in data engineering, teams can move from reactive problem-solving to a proactive stance on improving data systems' reliability and efficiency, ultimately supporting better decision-making and operational performance across the organization.
