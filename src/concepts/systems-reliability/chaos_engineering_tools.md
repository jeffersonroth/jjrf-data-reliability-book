# Chaos Engineering Tools
Chaos engineering tools, such as Gremlin or Chaos Mesh, introduce controlled disruptions into data systems (like network latency, server failures, or resource exhaustion) to test and improve their resilience. By proactively identifying and addressing potential points of failure, data systems become more robust and reliable.
