# Corrective Actions

## Corrective Action and Preventive Action Process (CAPA) & Corrective Action Process (CAP)
>
> As part of the Corrective Action and Preventive Action Process (CAPA), the Corrective Action Process (CAP) aims to identify failures, determine their root causes, and take corrective actions. This process also involves implementing preventive measures to avoid the recurrence of the same failure for the same reasons. You can find the complete definition in ISO 9001.

Different tools and techniques are used for their application in various industries, such as PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act), DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control), 8D, etc. Typically, any tool, technique, or methodology is summarized in ISO 9001 in seven "steps":

1. **Define the problem**. This step involves confirming the problem is real and identifying the Who, What, When, Where, and Why. This step should be automated as much as possible, with the failure detected through sensors.
2. **Define the scope**. It involves measuring the problem to be solved, knowing its frequency, which processes or tasks it affects, and which stakeholders are impacted. For data processes, many scope details should already be known from the design of the processes and tasks, and the frequency can be determined from observability and FRACAS processes.
3. **Containment actions**. These are specific measures adopted for the shortest possible time while working on a definitive solution to the failure. Such measures should already be designed in advance for each task or sub-task. The selection of measures should be automated, or if not, they should be implemented immediately.
4. **Root cause identification**. A clear, precise, and comprehensive failure diagnosis. Its documentation is part of the FRACAS.
5. **Corrective action planning**. Plan corrective actions based explicitly on the root cause.
6. **Implementation of corrective actions**. This involves the final implementation of corrective actions in the process, which should automatically be available when similar failures occur.
7. **Follow-up on results**. Documentation, communication, complete FRACAS.

Corrective Actions in data engineering involve identifying, addressing, and mitigating the root causes of identified problems within data processes and systems to prevent their recurrence. This systematic approach is crucial for maintaining the integrity, reliability, and efficiency of data operations. Here's how Corrective Actions can be applied in data engineering:

### Identification of Issues

The first step in the Corrective Action process is accurately identifying issues within data systems. This could range from data quality problems, pipeline failures, and performance bottlenecks to security vulnerabilities. Automated monitoring tools, data quality frameworks, and alerting systems are vital in early detection.

### Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Once an issue is identified, a thorough Root Cause Analysis is conducted to understand the underlying cause of the problem. Techniques such as the Five Whys, fishbone diagrams, or Pareto analysis can be employed. For instance, if a data pipeline fails frequently due to specific data format inconsistencies, RCA would seek to uncover why these inconsistencies occur.

### Planning Corrective Actions

Based on the RCA findings, a corrective action plan is developed. This plan outlines the steps needed to address the root cause of the problem. In the data pipeline example, if the root cause is incorrect data formatting at the source, a corrective action could involve, for example, implementing stricter data validation checks at the data ingestion stage.

### Implementation of Corrective Actions

The planned corrective actions are then implemented. This might involve modifying data validation rules, updating ETL scripts, enhancing data quality checks, or even redesigning parts of the data pipeline for better error handling and resilience.

### Verification and Monitoring

After the corrective actions are implemented, verifying their effectiveness in resolving the issue and monitoring the system for unintended consequences is crucial. This could involve running test cases, monitoring data pipeline runs for a certain period, or employing data quality dashboards to ensure the issue does not recur.

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

All steps taken, from issue identification to implementing corrective actions and their outcomes, should be thoroughly documented. This documentation is a knowledge base for future reference and helps share learnings across the data engineering team and organization. It contributes to building a culture of continuous improvement.

### Preventive Measures

Beyond addressing the immediate issue, the insights gained during the corrective action process can inform preventive measures to avoid similar problems. This might include revising data handling policies, enhancing training for data engineers, or adopting new tools and technologies for better data management.

In data engineering, Corrective Actions are about fixing problems and improving processes and systems for long-term reliability and efficiency. By systematically addressing the root causes of issues, data teams can enhance the quality, security, and performance of their data infrastructure, supporting better decision-making and operational outcomes across the organization.
