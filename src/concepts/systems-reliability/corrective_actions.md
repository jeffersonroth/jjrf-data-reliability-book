# Corrective Actions
> Part of the CAPA (Corrective Action and Preventive Action Process), corrective actions (CAP - Corrective Action Process) consist of detecting failures, determining their root causes, corrective actions, and taking preventive measures to prevent the same failure from occurring for the same reasons. The complete definition is found in ISO 9001.

Various tools and techniques are used in different industries for their application, including PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act), DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, Control), 8D, etc. Generally, any tool, technique, or methodology is summarized in ISO 9001 in seven "steps":
1. **Define the problem**.This involves confirming that the problem is real and identifying the Who, What, When, Where, and Why. In the world of data engineering, this step should be as automated as possible, with the failure detected through sensors.
2. **Define the scope**. It involves measuring the problem to be solved, knowing its frequency, which processes or tasks it affects, and which stakeholders are impacted. For data processes, many scope details should already be known information from the design of the processes and tasks, and the frequency can be determined from observability and FRACAS processes.
3. **Containment actions**. These are specific measures adopted for the shortest possible time while working on a definitive solution to the failure. Such measures should already be designed in advance for each task or sub-task. The selection of measures should be automated; if not, they should be implemented immediately.
4. **Root cause identification**. A clear, precise, and comprehensive diagnosis of the failure. Its documentation is part of the FRACAS.
5. **Corrective action planning**. It involves planning corrective actions specifically based on the root cause.
6. **Implementation of corrective actions**. It involves the final implementation of corrective actions in the process, which should automatically be available when similar failures occur.
7. **Follow-up on results**. Documentation, communication, complete FRACAS.

Corrective Actions in data engineering involve identifying, addressing, and mitigating the root causes of identified problems within data processes and systems to prevent their recurrence. This approach is systematic and is crucial for maintaining the integrity, reliability, and efficiency of data operations. Here’s how Corrective Actions can be applied in data engineering:

### Identification of Issues
The first step in the Corrective Action process is the accurate identification of issues within data systems. This could range from data quality problems, data pipeline failures, performance bottlenecks, to security vulnerabilities. Automated monitoring tools, data quality frameworks, and alerting systems play a vital role in early detection.

### Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
Once an issue is identified, a thorough Root Cause Analysis is conducted to understand the underlying cause of the problem. Techniques such as the Five Whys, fishbone diagrams, or Pareto analysis can be employed. For instance, if a data pipeline fails frequently due to specific data format inconsistencies, RCA would seek to uncover why these inconsistencies are occurring in the first place.

### Planning Corrective Actions
Based on the findings from the RCA, a plan for corrective actions is developed. This plan outlines the steps needed to address the root cause of the problem. In the data pipeline example, if the root cause is found to be incorrect data formatting at the source, a corrective action could involve implementing stricter data validation checks at the data ingestion stage.

### Implementation of Corrective Actions
The planned corrective actions are then implemented. This might involve modifying data validation rules, updating ETL scripts, enhancing data quality checks, or even redesigning parts of the data pipeline for better error handling and resilience.

### Verification and Monitoring
After the corrective actions are implemented, it’s crucial to verify their effectiveness in resolving the issue and to monitor the system for any unintended consequences. This could involve running test cases, monitoring data pipeline runs for a certain period, or employing data quality dashboards to ensure the issue does not recur.

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
All steps taken, from issue identification to the implementation of corrective actions and their outcomes, should be thoroughly documented. This documentation serves as a knowledge base for future reference and helps in sharing learnings across the data engineering team and wider organization. It contributes to building a culture of continuous improvement.

### Preventive Measures
Beyond addressing the immediate issue, the insights gained during the corrective action process can inform preventive measures to avoid similar issues in the future. This might include revising data handling policies, enhancing training for data engineers, or adopting new tools and technologies for better data management.

In data engineering, Corrective Actions are not just about fixing problems but also about improving processes and systems for long-term reliability and efficiency. By systematically addressing the root causes of issues, data teams can enhance the quality, security, and performance of their data infrastructure, supporting better decision-making and operational outcomes across the organization.
