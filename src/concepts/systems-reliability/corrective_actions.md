# Corrective Actions

The Corrective Actions principle involves a systematic approach to identify, analyze, and rectify faults, errors, or non-conformities in processes, systems, or products, and to implement measures to prevent their recurrence. This principle is fundamental to quality management and reliability engineering, ensuring continuous improvement and adherence to standards. It emphasizes the importance of:

Identification: Recognizing and documenting specific issues or failures that have occurred.
Analysis: Investigating the root causes of these issues to understand why they happened.
Rectification: Implementing solutions or changes to correct the identified issues.
Prevention: Establishing controls, processes, or systems to prevent the recurrence of similar issues in the future.

The Corrective Actions principle is central to maintaining the integrity, reliability, and quality of operations, products, and services, contributing to overall operational excellence and customer satisfaction.

Corrective Action and Preventive Action Process (CAPA), the Corrective Action Process (CAP), and the Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action System (FRACAS) all fall under the broad category of corrective actions principles. These methodologies share a common goal of identifying, analyzing, and rectifying issues or failures within systems, processes, or products, and implementing preventive measures to avoid recurrence. While each has its specific focus and application area, they all emphasize the importance of a structured approach to problem-solving and continuous improvement, making them integral to quality management, reliability engineering, and risk mitigation strategies.

A data engineer perceives corrective actions as essential processes for maintaining and enhancing the quality, reliability, and efficiency of data systems and pipelines. From the perspective of a data engineer, corrective actions involve:

Issue Identification: Recognizing anomalies, discrepancies, or failures in data processes, such as data pipeline failures, data quality issues, or performance bottlenecks.

Root Cause Analysis: Investigating the underlying causes of identified issues, employing techniques such as data lineage tracking, log analysis, and performance metrics to pinpoint the source of problems.

Solution Implementation: Developing and applying fixes to address the root causes, which might involve correcting data transformation logic, optimizing data models, adjusting ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs, or updating data validation rules.

Preventive Measures: Implementing strategies to prevent future occurrences, such as enhancing data quality checks, incorporating more robust error handling in data pipelines, or introducing automated monitoring and alerting systems.

Documentation and Communication: Documenting the issue, the analysis process, the implemented solution, and the preventive measures taken. Communicating these actions to relevant stakeholders, including data team members, to foster a culture of transparency and continuous improvement.

### Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action System (FRACAS) Use Case

Although complete use cases will be explored in the book's next section, here's a small use case to understand the implementation and importance of FRACAS.

#### Background

A mature startup, "PaTech," has a complex data ecosystem with Airflow orchestrating ELT jobs via Airbyte, ETL processes through dbt models deployed in Kubernetes, and various data quality and observability tools like DataDog in place. Hundreds of engineers access the company's data lake and warehouse, while its data marts serve thousands of employees across all departments.

#### Challenge

Despite having advanced tools and processes, DataTech Innovations faces recurring data issues affecting data quality and availability, leading to decision-making delays and decreased trust in data systems.

#### FRACAS Implementation

1. **Failure Identification**:
  An anomaly detected by DataDog in the data warehouse triggers an alert. The issue involves a significant discrepancy in sales data reported by the ETL process, impacting downstream data marts and reports.
2. **Initial Reporting**:
  The alert automatically generates a Jira ticket, categorizing the issue as a high-priority data quality incident. The ticket includes initial diagnostic information from DataDog and Airflow logs.
3. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
  The data reliability engineering team, using logs from Airflow and Airbyte, identifies that a recent schema change in the source CRM system wasn't reflected in the ELT job, leading to incomplete sales data extraction.
4. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**:
  Further investigation reveals that the change notification from the CRM team was overlooked due to a communication gap, preventing the necessary adjustments in the ELT job.
5. Corrective Actions:
   * **Immediate**:
     The ELT job is temporarily halted, and the schema change is manually incorporated to restore the integrity of the sales data. The corrected data is re-processed, and the affected data marts and reports are updated.
   * **Systemic**:
     The team implements a new protocol for schema change notifications, including automated alerts and a checklist in the Airflow job deployment process to verify source system schemas.
6. **Preventive Measures**:
   * Introducing automated schema detection and validation in Airbyte to flag discrepancies before data extraction.
   * Establishing a cross-functional data schema change committee to ensure all schema changes are reviewed and communicated effectively across teams.
7. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**:
  The incident, RCA, corrective, and preventive measures are documented in the company's knowledge base. A company-wide presentation is conducted to share learnings, emphasizing the importance of communication and automated checks in preventing similar incidents.
8. **Monitoring and Review**:
  DataDog alerts are fine-tuned to detect similar anomalies more effectively. The effectiveness of the new schema change protocol and automated checks are monitored over the next quarter to ensure no repeat incidents.

#### Outcome

By implementing FRACAS, PaTech resolves the immediate data discrepancy issue and strengthens its data reliability framework, reducing the likelihood of similar failures. The incident fosters a culture of continuous improvement and cross-departmental collaboration, enhancing overall data trustworthiness and decision-making efficiency across the organization.

### Final Thoughts on Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action System (FRACAS)

By applying FRACAS, data teams can move from reactive problem-solving to a proactive stance on improving data systems' reliability and efficiency, ultimately supporting better decision-making and operational performance across the organization.

## Corrective Action and Preventive Action Process (CAPA) & Corrective Action Process (CAP)
>
> As part of the Corrective Action and Preventive Action Process (CAPA), the Corrective Action Process (CAP) aims to identify failures, determine their root causes, and take corrective actions. This process also involves implementing preventive measures to avoid the recurrence of the same failure for the same reasons. You can find the complete definition in ISO 9001.

Different tools and techniques are used for their application in various industries, such as PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act), DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control), 8D, etc. Typically, any tool, technique, or methodology is summarized in ISO 9001 in seven "steps":

1. **Define the problem**. This step involves confirming the problem is real and identifying the Who, What, When, Where, and Why. This step should be automated as much as possible, with the failure detected through sensors.
2. **Define the scope**. It involves measuring the problem to be solved, knowing its frequency, which processes or tasks it affects, and which stakeholders are impacted. For data processes, many scope details should already be known from the design of the processes and tasks, and the frequency can be determined from observability and FRACAS processes.
3. **Containment actions**. These are specific measures adopted for the shortest possible time while working on a definitive solution to the failure. Such measures should already be designed in advance for each task or sub-task. The selection of measures should be automated, or if not, they should be implemented immediately.
4. **Root cause identification**. A clear, precise, and comprehensive failure diagnosis. Its documentation is part of the FRACAS.
5. **Corrective action planning**. Plan corrective actions based explicitly on the root cause.
6. **Implementation of corrective actions**. This involves the final implementation of corrective actions in the process, which should automatically be available when similar failures occur.
7. **Follow-up on results**. Documentation, communication, complete FRACAS.

Corrective Actions in data engineering involve identifying, addressing, and mitigating the root causes of identified problems within data processes and systems to prevent their recurrence. This systematic approach is crucial for maintaining the integrity, reliability, and efficiency of data operations. Here's how Corrective Actions can be applied in data engineering:

### Identification of Issues

The first step in the Corrective Action process is accurately identifying issues within data systems. This could range from data quality problems, pipeline failures, and performance bottlenecks to security vulnerabilities. Automated monitoring tools, data quality frameworks, and alerting systems are vital in early detection.

### Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Once an issue is identified, a thorough Root Cause Analysis is conducted to understand the underlying cause of the problem. Techniques such as the Five Whys, fishbone diagrams, or Pareto analysis can be employed. For instance, if a data pipeline fails frequently due to specific data format inconsistencies, RCA would seek to uncover why these inconsistencies occur.

### Planning Corrective Actions

Based on the RCA findings, a corrective action plan is developed. This plan outlines the steps needed to address the root cause of the problem. In the data pipeline example, if the root cause is incorrect data formatting at the source, a corrective action could involve, for example, implementing stricter data validation checks at the data ingestion stage.

### Implementation of Corrective Actions

The planned corrective actions are then implemented. This might involve modifying data validation rules, updating ETL scripts, enhancing data quality checks, or even redesigning parts of the data pipeline for better error handling and resilience.

### Verification and Monitoring

After the corrective actions are implemented, verifying their effectiveness in resolving the issue and monitoring the system for unintended consequences is crucial. This could involve running test cases, monitoring data pipeline runs for a certain period, or employing data quality dashboards to ensure the issue does not recur.

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

All steps taken, from issue identification to implementing corrective actions and their outcomes, should be thoroughly documented. This documentation is a knowledge base for future reference and helps share learnings across the data engineering team and organization. It contributes to building a culture of continuous improvement.

### Preventive Measures

Beyond addressing the immediate issue, the insights gained during the corrective action process can inform preventive measures to avoid similar problems. This might include revising data handling policies, enhancing training for data engineers, or adopting new tools and technologies for better data management.

In data engineering, Corrective Actions are about fixing problems and improving processes and systems for long-term reliability and efficiency. By systematically addressing the root causes of issues, data teams can enhance the quality, security, and performance of their data infrastructure, supporting better decision-making and operational outcomes across the organization.
