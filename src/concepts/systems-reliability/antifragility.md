# Antifragility
>
> Inspired by Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book *Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder*, antifragility differs from resilience or robustness concepts, where systems seek to maintain their reliability level. Instead, from their design, systems increase their reliability concerning the system's inputs.

Antifragility proposes a system design change, which are commonly designed to be fragile, meaning they will fail if operated outside their requirements. Antifragility suggests the opposite, designing systems that improve when exposed to loads outside of the requirements. In this sense, systems are not only designed to respond to the expected or anticipated but interact with their environment in real-time and adapt to it.

Examples of antifragile systems:

* Self-healing
* Real time sensoring, monitoring
* Live FRACAS
* System Health Management
* Automatic Repair

Methods such as **Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Adaptation** and **Adaptive Load Balancing** might interest data teams, but they are not covered in this book. Adaptive Load Balancing, in particular, might be a interesting topic for Data Platform or Data DevOps teams.
