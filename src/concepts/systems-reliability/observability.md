# Observability

In the context of software and systems, observability refers to the ability to infer the internal states of a system based on its external outputs.
It extends beyond monitoring by capturing what's going wrong and providing insights into why it's happening.

Data Observability specifically applies observability principles to data and data systems.
It involves monitoring the health of the data flowing through systems, identifying anomalies, pipeline failures, and schema changes, and ensuring data quality and reliability.

### Justifications

Data observability is crucial for businesses that rely heavily on data-driven decision-making processes. It ensures that data quality and consistency are maintained across pipelines.
Secondly, it reduces downtime by enabling users to quickly identify and resolve data issues.
Finally, it enhances trust in data by providing transparency into data lineage, health, and usage.

### What They Solve

Data observability tools are designed to address common issues with data, including data downtime, which occurs when data is missing, erroneous, or otherwise unusable.
These tools can also help detect schema changes that may break downstream analytics and identify data drifts and anomalies that can lead to incorrect analytics.
Data observability tools can also optimize data pipelines and improve resource utilization, leading to more efficient data processing.

### Challenges

Implementing data observability can be challenging due to the vast volume and variety of data, which makes comprehensive observability difficult. Integrating observability tools with existing data systems and workflows can also be daunting; balancing observability overhead with system performance is critical.

### Methods

Data observability is achieved through:

* **Monitoring**: Tracking key metrics and logs to understand the system's health.
* **Tracing**: Following data through its entire lifecycle to understand its flow and transformations.
* **Alerting**: Setting up real-time notifications for anomalies or issues detected in the data.

### Toolkit

Several tools and platforms provide data observability capabilities, ranging from open-source projects to commercial solutions. They include:

* [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/) & [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/): Often used together, Prometheus is used for metrics collection, and Grafana is used for visualization; they can monitor data systems' performance and health.
* [**Elastic Stack (ELK)**](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/): Elasticsearch for search and data analytics, Logstash for data processing, and Kibana for data visualization offer a powerful stack for observability.
* [**Apache Airflow**](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/administration-and-deployment/logging-monitoring/index.html): While primarily a workflow orchestration tool, Airflow provides extensive logging and monitoring capabilities for data pipelines. Airflow can be set up to send metrics to StatsD or OpenTelemetry.
* [**DataDog**](https://www.datadoghq.com/): Offers a SaaS-based monitoring platform with capabilities for monitoring cloud-scale applications, including data pipelines. DataDog dashboards and metrics can be deployed using Terraform.
* [**Monte Carlo**](https://www.montecarlodata.com/): A data observability platform that uses machine learning to identify, evaluate, and remedy data reliability issues across data products.

Many contemporary data tools, including ELT and ETL platforms, support exporting metrics to [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd) and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).
Numerous tools (e.g., Airbyte) allow Prometheus integration within their Kubernetes deployment configurations.
