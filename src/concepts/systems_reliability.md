# Systems Reliability
> The reliability of a system is the property that allows the system's service to be justifiably qualified as reliable.

The goal of this chapter is to introduce the concepts of reliability and safety explored by Alan Burns and Andy Wellings in their book "Real-Time Systems and Programming Languages", concepts developed by different industries mainly between the 60s and 90s, and the concepts of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) developed from the 2000s onwards, in addition to complementing it with reliability concepts worked on in other engineering fields (mechanical, industrial, etc.), as well as contextualizing it with concepts currently worked on in the software and computer systems industry.

This chapter is divided in three parts, each exploring one of these concepts:

[**Impediments**](./impediments.md)
> Impediments prevent a system from functioning perfectly, or are a consequence of it. This subsection will address the detection of different types of impediments, which include **Failures**, **Errors**, and **Defects**.

[**Attributes**](./attributes.md)
> The way and measures by which the **quality of a reliable service can be estimated**.

[**Mechanisms**](./mechanisms.md)
> The mechanisms through which system reliability is addressed, whether by internalization and adoption of best practices, or by the application of specific methodologies, architectures, or tools. This subsection aims to create a **framework** that engineers can adopt for system reliability from the design phase itself.
