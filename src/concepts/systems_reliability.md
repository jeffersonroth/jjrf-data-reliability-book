# Systems Reliability
> The reliability of a system is the property that allows the system's service to be justifiably qualified as reliable.

This chapter introduces the concepts of reliability and safety explored by Alan Burns and Andy Wellings in their book "Real-Time Systems and Programming Languages." These concepts, developed by different industries mainly between the 60s and 90s, and the concepts of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), developed from the 2000s onwards, in addition to complementing it with reliability concepts worked on in other engineering fields (mechanical, industrial, etc.), as well as contextualizing it with concepts currently worked on in the software and computer systems industry.

I divided this chapter into three parts, each exploring one of these concepts:

[**Impediments**](./systems-reliability/impediments.md)
> Impediments prevent a system from functioning perfectly or are a consequence of it. This chapter covers impediment classification, including **Failures**, **Errors**, and **Defects**.

[**Attributes**](./systems-reliability/attributes.md)
> Attributes are the ways and measures by which the **quality of a reliable service can be estimated**.

[**Mechanisms**](./systems-reliability/mechanisms.md)
> This chapter addresses system reliability mechanisms by internalizing and adopting best practices or applying specific methodologies, architectures, or tools. This chapter aims to create a **data system reliability framework** that engineers can adopt from earlier implementation phases, such as the design phase.
