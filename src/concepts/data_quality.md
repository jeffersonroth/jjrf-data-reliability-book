# Data Quality
Goals for the chapter:
* To equip data reliability engineers, data platform engineers, data analysts, and data teams with a comprehensive understanding of data quality principles, practices, and frameworks, emphasizing their critical role in ensuring reliable data systems.
* To bridge the gap between theoretical data quality concepts and their practical application in data reliability engineering, providing actionable insights for improving data systems' robustness and dependability.
* To highlight the integral relationship between data quality and data reliability, demonstrating how robust data quality practices underpin the effectiveness of data reliability engineering efforts.
* To introduce a variety of data quality models, standards, and best practices, enabling data professionals to assess, monitor, and enhance the quality of data within their organizations, thus contributing to overall system reliability.
* To explore the lifecycle of data from a reliability perspective, showing how each phase from creation to disposal impacts data quality and, by extension, the reliability of data-driven decisions and processes.

This chapter aims to lay a solid foundation in data quality for professionals involved in ensuring data reliability, providing them with the knowledge and tools necessary to identify and address quality issues that could compromise data integrity and system performance.

The structure and order of topics within this chapter on Data Quality are inspired by the comprehensive work presented in the book "Calidad de Datos" (Data Quality), authored by Ismael Caballero MuÃ±oz-Reja, among other contributors. This book is published by "Ediciones de la U" and "Ra-Ma". The chosen framework and sequence of subjects are drawn from this authoritative source to ensure a well-rounded and in-depth exploration of data quality concepts relevant to Data Reliability Engineering. This alignment with established literature in the field is intended to provide readers with a structured and coherent understanding of data quality, leveraging the expertise and insights from leading experts in the domain.
