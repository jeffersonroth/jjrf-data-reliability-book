# Data Quality
Goals for the chapter:

* To bridge the gap between theoretical data quality concepts and their practical application in data reliability engineering, providing actionable insights for improving data systems' robustness and dependability.

* To introduce a variety of data quality models, standards, and best practices, enabling data professionals to assess, monitor, and enhance the quality of data within their organizations, thus contributing to overall system reliability.

The structure and order of topics within this chapter on Data Quality are inspired by the comprehensive work presented in the book "Calidad de Datos" (Data Quality), authored by Ismael Caballero Mu√±oz-Reja, among other contributors. This book is published by "Ediciones de la U" and "Ra-Ma". The chosen framework and sequence of subjects are drawn from this authoritative source to ensure a well-rounded and in-depth exploration of data quality concepts relevant to Data Reliability Engineering. This alignment with established literature in the field is intended to provide readers with a structured and coherent understanding of data quality, leveraging the expertise and insights from leading experts in the domain.
