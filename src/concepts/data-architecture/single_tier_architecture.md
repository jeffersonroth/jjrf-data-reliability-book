# Single-Tier Architecture

Single-tier architecture, often referred to as a **monolithic architecture**, is a software application model where the user interface, business logic, and data storage layers are combined into a single program or platform that runs on a single platform or server.

```admonish tip title="Single-Tier Architecture"
This architecture is characterized by its simplicity and is often used for smaller applications or systems where scalability, high availability, and distributed processing are not primary concerns.
```
Characteristics of Single-Tier Architecture:

* **Simplicity**: Because all components are housed within a single layer or platform, the architecture is straightforward to develop, deploy, and manage.
* **Tight Coupling**: The application's components and layers (UI, business logic, and data storage) are tightly coupled, so changes to one component can potentially impact others.
* **Ease of Deployment**: Deployment is generally simpler since there's only one application to deploy, without the need to manage communication between separate layers or services.
* **Limited Scalability**: Scaling the application typically means scaling the entire application stack together, which can be inefficient and costly, especially for larger applications.
* **Single Point of Failure**: The entire application resides on a single server or platform, making it vulnerable to a single point of failure that can make the entire application unavailable in case of a server failure.

When discussing single-tier architecture in data systems, the focus shifts to systems where data storage, management, and processing occur within a single environment or platform.
Here are some examples tailored to data systems:

```admonish example title="Local Database Systems"
Small-scale applications, like a standalone desktop application used for inventory management or personal finance, employ a single-tier architecture by integrating a local database system (e.g., SQLite) within the application.
The application directly interacts with this local database for all data storage, retrieval, and processing needs without relying on external services or layers.
```

```admonish example title="Local Database Systems"
Many smart devices or IoT (Internet of Things) devices use single-tier architecture for data handling.
For instance, a smart thermostat might collect, process, and store data about temperature preferences, usage patterns, and environmental data all within the device itself using an embedded database.
```

```admonish example title="Local Database Systems"
In some small businesses or personal projects, spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets can serve as a single-tier data system.
Users can input data, use built-in functions for data processing and analysis, and store the information within the spreadsheet file.
While not a "database" in the traditional sense, this setup functions as a single-tier data system for many basic applications.
```

```admonish example title="Local Database Systems"
Some minimalistic web applications use file-based data storage (such as JSON, XML files, or even plain text files) to store data directly on the server's filesystem.
These applications handle data storage, processing, and presentation in a single layer without the need for separate database management systems.
```

```admonish example title="Local Database Systems"
Tools designed for specific data analysis tasks, such as log file analyzers or small-scale data visualization tools, might encapsulate data ingestion, processing, and visualization within a single application.
Users can load data files into the tool, which then processes and presents the analysis or visualizations without relying on external systems.
```

Single-tier architectures in data systems are characterized by their simplicity and self-contained nature, making them suitable for applications with limited scalability requirements and where ease of deployment and management are priorities.
However, as data needs grow in complexity and volume, the limitations of single-tier architectures, such as scalability challenges and the difficulty of managing complex data processing tasks, often necessitate moving to more layered, distributed architectures.
