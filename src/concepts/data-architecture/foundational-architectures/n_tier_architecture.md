```admonish tip title="N-Tier Architecture"
N-tier architecture is an extension of the three-tier architecture that further separates concerns and functionalities into more discrete layers or tiers.
This approach enhances scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, making it suitable for complex, large-scale applications and data systems.
```

In the context of data systems, n-tier architecture might involve the following tiers, each focusing on specific aspects of the system:

**Presentation Tier**:
This is the user interface layer where users interact with the system. It could include web clients, desktop applications, mobile apps, and dashboards.

**Business Logic Tier**:
This layer handles the application's core functionality, including data processing logic, business rules, and task coordination. It acts as an intermediary between the presentation and data layers.

**Data Access Tier**:
This tier is responsible for communicating with the data storage layer. It abstracts the underlying data operations (like CRUD operations) from the business logic layer, providing a more modular approach.

**Data Storage Tier**:
This is where the data resides. It can include relational databases, NoSQL databases, file systems, or even external data sources. For more complex systems, this tier might comprise multiple databases or storage solutions, each optimized for specific types of data or access patterns.

**Cache Tier**:
An optional but often crucial layer, the cache tier stores frequently accessed data in memory to speed up data retrieval and reduce the load on the data storage tier.

**Integration Tier**:
An integration tier handles these interactions in systems that must communicate with external services, APIs, or legacy systems, ensuring the core system remains decoupled from external dependencies.

**Security Tier**:
This dedicated layer manages authentication, authorization, and security policies, centralizing security mechanisms instead of scattering them across other tiers.

**Analytics and Reporting Tier**:
Especially for data systems, an analytics tier might be included to handle data warehousing, big data processing, and business intelligence operations, separate from the operational data systems.

**Microservices/Service Layer**:
Each microservice can be considered a tier in a microservices architecture, encapsulating a specific business capability and communicating with other services through well-defined interfaces.

**Application/Service Orchestration Tier**:
This layer manages the interactions and workflows between different services or components, especially in a microservices or distributed environment.

In an n-tier architecture, each tier can scale independently, be updated or maintained without significantly impacting other parts of the system, and even be distributed across different servers or environments to enhance performance and reliability.
This architecture provides high flexibility and modularity, allowing teams to adopt new technologies, scale parts of the system as needed, and improve resilience by isolating failures to specific tiers.

However, the complexity of managing an n-tier architecture should not be underestimated.
It requires careful planning, robust infrastructure, and effective communication mechanisms between tiers, often increasing development and maintenance costs.
Proper implementation of n-tier architectures can lead to highly scalable, flexible, and maintainable systems, making them suitable for complex enterprise-level applications and data systems.

Here are examples of n-tier architecture applied in scenarios where data engineering and analytics teams play a central role:

```admonish example title="Data Analytics Platform"
**Presentation Tier**: Web-based dashboards and visualization tools that allow business users to interact with complex datasets, generating custom reports and visual insights.

**Business Logic Tier**: Custom analytics engines and services that process business logic, such as trend analysis, forecasting, and segmentation algorithms, tailored to specific business needs.

**Data Access Tier**: APIs and services designed to abstract and manage queries to various data sources, ensuring efficient data retrieval and updates according to user interactions on the dashboards.

**Data Processing Tier**: Dedicated microservices or batch processing jobs that clean, transform, and enrich raw data from various sources, preparing it for analysis. This might involve ETL processes, data normalization, and application of business rules.

**Data Storage Tier**: A combination of data warehouses for structured data and data lakes for unstructured or semi-structured data, optimized for analytical queries and big data processing.

**Cache Tier**: Caching mechanisms for storing frequently accessed reports, dashboards, and intermediate data sets to speed up data retrieval and improve user experience.

**Integration Tier**: Connectors and integration services that pull data from diverse sources like CRM systems, ERP systems, web analytics, and IoT devices, ensuring a seamless flow of data into the platform.

**Security and Compliance Tier**: Enforces data access policies, authentication, encryption, and audit trails to ensure data security and compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.

**Data Governance Tier**: Tools and services that manage data cataloging, quality control, lineage tracking, and metadata management to maintain high data integrity and usability across the platform.
```

```admonish example title="Real-time Data Processing System for IoT"
**Presentation Tier**: A real-time dashboard displaying metrics, alerts, and analytics derived from IoT device data, enabling operational teams to monitor performance and respond to events as they occur.

**Business Logic Tier**: Stream processing services that apply real-time analytics, pattern recognition, and decision-making logic to incoming data streams, triggering automated responses or alerts based on predefined criteria.

**Data Access Tier**: Services that manage access to real-time data streams and historical data, ensuring efficient data retrieval for real-time and historical trend analyses.

**Data Ingestion Tier**: Microservices that handle the ingestion of high-velocity data streams from thousands of IoT devices, ensuring data is reliably captured, pre-processed, and routed to the appropriate services for further processing.

**Data Storage Tier**: Time-series databases optimized for storing and querying high-velocity, time-stamped data from IoT devices alongside data lakes or warehouses for longer-term storage and more complex analysis.

**Cache Tier**: In-memory data stores that cache critical real-time analytics and frequently queried data to ensure rapid access for real-time decision-making and dashboard updates.

**Integration Tier**: Integration with external systems and services, such as weather data APIs, geolocation services, or third-party analytics platforms, enriching IoT data with additional context for more sophisticated analytics.

**Security Tier**: Implements robust security protocols for device authentication, data encryption in transit and at rest, and fine-grained access controls to protect sensitive IoT data and analytics results.

**Data Quality and Governance Tier**: Automated tools and services that continuously monitor data quality, perform anomaly detection, and ensure that data flowing through the system adheres to defined governance policies and standards.
```

These examples demonstrate how n-tier architecture can be tailored to meet the specific needs of data-intensive applications, enabling data engineers and analytics teams to build scalable, flexible, and secure systems that support complex data processing and analytics workflows.

## Use Case

Brief of the current architecture, and how it evolve from the previous one.
```

### Proposal and Implementation Plan

[Opetence Inc.](../../../use-cases/opetence/opetence_inc.md) updated its data infrastructure to enhance efficiency and scalability, centralizing around Apache Airflow for orchestrating data pipelines and dbt for data transformations.
This setup streamlined workflows and simplified data processing. Nightly ELT processes for microservices' databases were automated using Airbyte, reducing system load by scheduling tasks during off-peak hours.
A significant upgrade involved adopting Amazon S3 buckets for storing raw data in Parquet format, leveraging cloud storage's scalability and cost-effectiveness.
Redash was introduced to enable non-analytics teams to query transformed data marts, fostering a broader data-driven culture.
DataHub was implemented as the go-to metadata management system to manage the growing importance of metadata, enhancing data discoverability and trust.
For the near real-time operational data, a bespoke microservice created a Data Operational Store (DOS), directly feeding operational dashboards and platforms like Tableau through a secured API Gateway, ensuring streamlined and controlled data access.

This restructuration reflects the n-tier architecture as follows:

* **Data Ingestion Tier**:
  * Airbyte for nightly ELT processes from microservices' databases.
  * Fivetran for specific third-party integrations.
  * Custom solutions for Google Sheets data ingestion.
* **Data Storage Tier**:
  * Amazon S3 buckets for storing raw data in Parquet format.
  * Aurora Postgres instances for staging, transformed, and operational data.
  * Data Processing and Transformation Tier:
  * Apache Airflow for orchestrating data pipelines.
  * dbt for data transformation and preparing data marts.
* **Data Access and API Management Tier**:
  * API Gateway to provide secure and unified access to data for various consumers.
* **Data Operational Store (DOS) Tier**:
  * A specialized microservice creating a DOS for near real-time operational data needs.
* **Analytics and Reporting Tier**:
  * Redash to enable broader access to data insights and reporting outside the analytics team.
  * Tableau and other dashboard platforms for operational teams, accessing DOS data through the API Gateway.
  * Tableau for Business Intelligence dashboards, accessing the marts through direct database access.
* **Metadata Management Tier**:
  * DataHub as the metadata management system to enhance data discoverability, governance, and trust.

This structure illustrates the n-tier architecture's ability to decompose the data ecosystem into specialized, scalable tiers, each focused on a distinct aspect of data handling and analysis, ensuring efficiency and adaptability.

**Accessing the DOS for Near Real-Time Operational Data**:

* **API Gateway Integration**: Tableau accesses near real-time operational data through an API Gateway, which acts as the intermediary between Tableau and the DOS. The API Gateway manages authentication, authorization, request routing, and potentially data transformation to ensure Tableau receives the necessary operational data in the required format.
* **Real-Time Data Feeds**: The DOS is optimized for speed and efficiency, providing Tableau with the latest operational data. This setup is crucial for dashboards that monitor real-time metrics or operational KPIs, where up-to-the-minute data is essential.

**Accessing the Analytics Database for Business Dashboards**:

* **Direct Database Connection**: Tableau connects directly to the Analytics Aurora Postgres database for business intelligence dashboards, where transformed and aggregated data marts are stored. This connection might use Tableau's built-in database connectors, allowing for efficient querying and data visualization.
* **Data Transformation and Mart**: The data within the Analytics database has been pre-processed and transformed (using dbt) to support business intelligence needs. This data is structured into marts that are optimized for analysis, enabling Tableau to generate comprehensive business dashboards.

In this dual-access setup, Tableau leverages the strengths of both data stores—real-time operational insights from the DOS and in-depth analytical views from the Analytics database.
The API Gateway manages and secures access to the DOS, ensuring operational data is delivered swiftly and securely to support real-time decision-making.
Meanwhile, the direct connection to the Analytics database allows for deep insights into business performance metrics, trends, and strategic insights, supported by the rich, pre-processed data in the data marts.
This bifurcated approach ensures that users have the right data in the right context, whether for immediate operational needs or longer-term strategic analysis.

Please note that, even with all these updates, the company would benefit more, with probably a lower price, from implementing a proper data lake, data warehouse architecture, or a combination of both.
These and many more architectures will be discussed in detail later on.
