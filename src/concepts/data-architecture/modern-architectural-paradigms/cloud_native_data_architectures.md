## Use Case

In this hypothetical use case, [Opetence Inc.](../../../use-cases/opetence/opetence_inc.md) received a significant round of investments, part of which would be invested in modernizing and automating the data processes. The data infrastructure should work flawlessly so the company can focus its resources on the analytics team, managing data marts and dashboards that could support all the business needs. As advised by the investors' AWS solutions architect, the new architecture would include:

```admonish tldr title="AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)"
* **Purpose**: Used to migrate relational databases, data warehouses, NoSQL databases, and other types of data stores to AWS. In this scenario, it continuously captures data changes and loads them into Amazon S3, serving as the initial ingestion point.
* **Process**: Configure AWS DMS tasks to capture data from source databases and replicate it to Amazon S3 buckets in Parquet format.
```

```admonish tldr title="AWS Lake Formation"
* **Purpose**: Simplifies the setup and management of a secure and efficient data lake. It handles data cataloging, cleaning, classification, audition, and securing data access. It integrates with **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** to encrypt PII and sensitive information.
* **Process**: Once data is in S3, use Lake Formation to define a data catalog, set up permissions, and manage metadata for the datasets in S3. This is the foundation for a structured data lake ready for analysis and querying.
```

```admonish tldr title="AWS Glue"
* **Purpose**: Serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.
* **Process**: Use AWS Glue for ETL (extract, transform, load) jobs to clean, transform, and enrich the raw data in S3. This might involve deduplication, schema evolution, and data partitioning to optimize for analytics.
```

```admonish tldr title="AWS Redshift Spectrum"
* **Purpose**: Allow complex queries to run directly on data stored in S3, using the same SQL syntax as Redshift, without needing to load the data into Redshift tables.
* **Process**: Define external tables in Redshift Spectrum that point to the S3 data locations. This allows for querying vast amounts of data in S3 directly from Redshift, enabling seamless integration of the data lake with Redshift's powerful analytics capabilities. The dbt models can use these external tables directly.
```

The solutions architect suggested using Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA). Still, it was agreed that the current ECS + Fargate solution would be optimal, given it's already implemented, similar DevOps processes in the company employ a similar solution, and the data engineering team is already adopting the solution to deploy dbt and many internal scripts and tools.

### Revised Architecture and Infrastructure Overview

The Use Cases section will discuss the detailed implementation for each tool, solution, or platform. Once the data engineering team finishes implementing all suggested changes, the data architecture will comprehend the following:

```admonish tldr title="Data Ingestion and Integration"
**AWS DMS** would be responsible for replicating all the internal operational data to an S3 bucket in Parquet format. Data partners capable of delivering their data directly to the company's S3 buckets, such as **Braze** and **Segment**, would continue to do so. **Fivetran** would manage any other data partner, as the team agreed to deprecate the Airbyte solution deployed to AWS EKS.
```

```admonish tldr title="Data Storage and Management"
S3 would be the primary data storage solution, housing both raw and processed data. S3's scalability and robust security features make it ideal for managing large volumes of data. **AWS Lake Formation** would then organize the data within S3 into a structured data lake, improving data discoverability and accessibility while maintaining governance and security.
```

```admonish tldr title="Data Processing and Transformation"
Working directly in the Parquet files in S3, many containerized solutions would continue to be deployed to **AWS ECS**, many transformations would continue to be deployed to **AWS Lambda** functions, and small **Python** and **Bash** scripts would continue to be executed directly by Airflow. A few would be rewritten in **AWS Glue**.
```

```admonish tldr title="Analytics and Business Intelligence"
The data marts would continue to be managed by **dbt** models, which now consume the Data Lake files directly using **AWS Redshift Spectrum**. The marts are now stored in **AWS Redshift**. Business intelligence tools like **Tableau** are integrated with Redshift to enable advanced data visualization and reporting, supporting data-driven decision-making.
```

```admonish tldr title="Security and Compliance Framework"
**IAM Roles** and **Policies** ensure granular access control to AWS resources, adhering to best practices in security and compliance. Data is **encrypted** both at rest and in transit, meeting industry and regulatory standards for data security.
```

```admonish tldr title="System Monitoring and Optimization"
**AWS CloudWatch** offers monitoring and logging for AWS resources, providing insights into system performance and operational health to maintain optimal performance.
```

```admonish tldr title="Workflow Orchestration and Operations"
**Apache Airflow** would continue to be the backbone and heart of all the data architecture. It orchestrates, triggers, and monitors all of the architecture components above.
```

### Identifying Architectural Risks and Challenges

The team at Opetence Inc. is on a promising path with their planned infrastructure enhancements. However, a few additional considerations and potential risks associated with vendor lock-in could be addressed:

* **Reduced Flexibility**: Heavy reliance on a single vendor's technologies and services can limit the ability to adopt new tools or services that may offer better performance or cost savings.
* **Cost Control**: Being locked into a single vendor's ecosystem might lead to less competitive pricing and higher costs in the long run as the bargaining power diminishes.
