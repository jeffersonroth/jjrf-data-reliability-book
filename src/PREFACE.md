# Preface

Adopting robust, reliable, and secure data systems is crucial for ensuring data integrity, supporting informed decision-making, and safeguarding sensitive information against breaches and failures.
"**Data Reliability Engineering: Reliability Frameworks for Building Safe, Reliable, and Highly Available Data Systems**" endeavors to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application in data systems reliability.
At its core, this book is about creating complex systems—encompassing hardware, software, databases, and more—working in harmony toward reliable data processing, storage, and management.

My journey into data reliability engineering began with my studies in Industrial Automation and Mechanical Engineering, leading to an internship in Powertrain Engineering at Volvo Group Trucks Technology.
There, I delved into systems and application engineering, focusing on Logged Vehicle Data analysis and data mining.
This experience highlighted the importance of reliability in systems where failures could have profound consequences.
As I transitioned to data-centric roles, I observed a distinct approach to systems reliability.
This contrast inspired me to contemplate how the principles of systems reliability could enhance the design of data systems.
This book is a culmination of those reflections, aimed at offering practical guidance for building your own Reliability Framework.

The book is inspired by foundational reliability engineering principles and extends these concepts into the domain of data systems.
It provides a detailed exploration of modern data architecture and the tools and technologies that support data transformation, orchestration, and management.
By marrying the principles of reliability engineering with the intricacies of data system design and operation, this book offers a structured approach for professionals aiming to fortify their data systems against failures and enhance system availability.

The intended audience for this book includes data engineers, data architects, data platform engineers, and systems engineers looking to specialize or transition into data-focused roles.
It serves as a comprehensive guide for those committed to the development and maintenance of reliable data systems.

Welcome to a journey towards building safer, more reliable, and highly available data systems.
This journey promises to elevate the standard of data reliability engineering, guiding you in creating a Reliability Framework that ensures the resilience and efficiency of your data infrastructure.
