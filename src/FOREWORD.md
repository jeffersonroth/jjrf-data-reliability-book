# Foreword

Adopting robust, reliable, and secure data systems is crucial for ensuring data integrity, supporting informed decision-making, and safeguarding sensitive information against breaches and failures. "Data Reliability Engineering: Reliability Frameworks for Building Safe, Reliable, and Highly Available Data Systems" is a comprehensive guide that endeavors to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application in data reliability. At its core, this book is about systems, complex arrangements of interconnected components—hardware, software, databases, procedures, and people—working in unison toward efficient and reliable data processing, storage, and management.

Inspired by the foundational principles presented by Alan Burns and Andy Wellings in "Real-Time Systems and Programming Languages," this book extends the concepts of system reliability and safety into the domain of data systems. It explores how the disciplines of Reliability Engineering, developed and refined across various industries over decades, can be applied to ensure the predictability, error-free operation, and consistent service delivery of data systems.

The essence of data reliability engineering is captured through an in-depth examination of data quality—a pillar upon which the dependability of data systems rests. This book emphasizes the significance of data quality dimensions such as accuracy, completeness, and consistency, highlighting their role in building data systems that organizations can rely on for precise decision-making and streamlined operations.

Moreover, "Data Reliability Engineering" provides a detailed exploration of modern data architecture, including data warehouses, data lakes, and data marts, alongside a thorough discussion of the tools and technologies that facilitate data transformation, orchestration, and management.

By marrying the principles of reliability engineering with the practicalities of data system design and operation, this book offers a structured framework for professionals looking to fortify their data systems against failures, enhance system availability, and safeguard data integrity. Whether you're an experienced data engineer, a budding data architect, or a decision-maker looking to understand the underpinnings of reliable data systems, this book serves as an indispensable resource for navigating the complexities of data reliability engineering.

Welcome to a journey towards building safer, more reliable, and highly available data systems—a journey that promises to elevate the standard of data reliability engineering and foster a culture of excellence in data management practices.
