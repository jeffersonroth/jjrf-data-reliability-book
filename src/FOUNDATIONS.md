## Key Definitions

### Systems vs. Data Systems

```admonish tip title="Defining Systems"
This book defines a system as a *complex arrangement of interconnected components, including hardware, software, databases, procedures, and people, that work together towards a common goal*. For data systems, particularly, this goal is often to process, store, and manage data efficiently and reliably.
```

In systems engineering, a data system is regarded as a subsystem of a larger system, which includes not only the technology but also the people, processes, and policies that ensure the system meets its intended functions efficiently and effectively.

```admonish tip title="Defining Data Systems"
This book defines a system as a *subsystem of a larger system that includes the architecture, technology, and protocols in place to ensure data integrity, availability, and consistency*. Operationally, it entails the procedures and practices employed to maintain the system's performance and reliability over time.
```

When discussing data reliability engineering, a data system encompasses the entire ecosystem that supports the data lifecycle, which includes data creation, storage, retrieval, and usage. A comprehensive data system considers redundancy, fault tolerance, backup procedures, security measures, and regular maintenance practices. All of these elements contribute to the overall reliability of the system and the trustworthiness of its service.

Various fields may have slightly different interpretations or emphasize different aspects of data systems, but here are some common definitions:

* **Information Technology (IT) and Computer Science**:
  In these fields, a data system is often viewed as a software and hardware infrastructure designed to collect, store, manage, process, and analyze data. This encompasses databases, data warehouses, big data systems, and data processing frameworks.

* **Business and Enterprise**:
  From a business perspective, a data system is considered an essential part of the organization's information system strategy, supporting decision-making, operations, and management. It includes not only the technical infrastructure but also the organizational processes and policies that govern data usage, quality, security, and compliance.

* **Data Engineering**:
  In data engineering, a data system is seen as the architecture and infrastructure for handling data workflows, including ingestion, storage, transformation, and delivery of data. It focuses on efficiency, scalability, reliability, and maintainability of data processing and storage.

* **Data Science and Analytics**:
  From this viewpoint, a data system is a platform or environment that facilitates the extraction of insights, patterns, and trends from data. It includes tools and processes for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## Systems Reliability vs. Data Systems Reliability

```admonish tip title="Defining Systems Reliability"
This book defines systems reliability by its adherence to a clear, complete, consistent, and unambiguous behavior specification.
```

This definition applies to both **Systems Reliability** and **Data Systems Reliability**, as systems reliability refers to the ability of a system, which can be mechanical, electrical, software, or any other engineered system, to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time without failure.
It encompasses a wide range of systems, from simple tools to complex networks like power grids or transportation systems.
The focus is on ensuring the entire system operates reliably, including its hardware, software, human operators, and the interactions between these components.
Reliability in this context involves redundancy, fault tolerance, maintainability, and robustness against various failure modes.

Data systems reliability pertains explicitly to the reliability of systems that handle data, such as databases, data warehouses, data pipelines, and big data platforms.
Data systems reliability focuses on ensuring that these systems can accurately store, process, and retrieve data as expected, without loss, corruption, or unacceptable performance degradation.
This involves not only the reliability of the software and hardware components but also aspects like data integrity, data security, backup and recovery processes, and the consistency of data across distributed systems.

## Reliability Engineering vs. Data Reliability Engineering (vs. Data Reliability)

**Reliability Engineering** and **Data Reliability Engineering** share a common foundation in the principles of reliability and engineering but diverge in their specific domains and challenges.
Reliability Engineering spans various engineering disciplines, ensuring systems perform reliably under specified conditions.
This involves analyzing potential failures, enhancing designs for robustness, and implementing redundancy and fault tolerance.
Reliability engineers employ a range of tools, such as failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), reliability block diagrams (RBD), fault tree analysis, and statistical reliability analysis, to predict and enhance the reliability of both physical and software systems.

On the other hand, data reliability engineering is specifically concerned with the reliability of data systems, such as databases, data warehouses, data lakes, and data pipelines.
It focuses on maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and availability of data within these systems, addressing challenges like data corruption, loss, duplication, and inconsistencies across distributed systems.
Ensuring that data pipelines accurately process and deliver data as intended is a key aspect of this role.
Data reliability engineers adopt practices including comprehensive data testing, continuous data quality monitoring, the construction of resilient data pipelines, the implementation of robust backup and recovery systems, and the maintenance of data integrity across distributed systems.

While reliability engineering broadly addresses the reliability of diverse systems, focusing on their physical and functional aspects, data reliability engineering is specifically dedicated to the reliability of systems that handle and process data, ensuring data remains trustworthy and accessible.

```admonish tip title="Defining Data Reliability Engineering"
This book defines data reliability engineering as the *specialized practices and methodologies aimed at creating and maintaining systems, infrastructure, and processes that support and enhance the reliability of data throughout its lifecycle*, from collection and storage to processing and analysis.
```

Another related term that might be confused is **Data Reliability**. It refers to the trustworthiness and dependability of data. The chapter on [data quality](./concepts/data_quality.md) will explore it in greater detail, particularly when discussing the [reliability dimension](./concepts/data-quality/reliability_dimension.md) of data quality models.

```admonish tip title="Defining Data Reliability"
This book defines data reliability as the *degree of trustworthiness and dependability of the data, ensuring it consistently produces the same results under similar conditions and over time*.
