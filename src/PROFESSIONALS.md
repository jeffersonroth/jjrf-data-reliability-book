# Incorporating Data Reliability Engineering

Professionals who might incorporate data reliability engineering roles in the absence of a dedicated role are as follows:

Data Engineers: They work closely with data pipelines and are naturally positioned to focus on data reliability aspects such as data quality, pipeline robustness, and system resilience.

Data Platform Engineers: Similar to data engineers, they work on the infrastructure that supports data systems, making them likely candidates to adopt data reliability engineering practices.

DevOps Engineers: With their expertise in system reliability and automation, DevOps engineers can extend their role to encompass data reliability, especially in environments where data operations are closely integrated with system operations.

Solutions Architects: They design the overall system architecture and can include data reliability as a key component of system reliability and resilience in their designs.

Cloud Engineers: Given the increasing reliance on cloud-based data solutions, cloud engineers who manage and optimize cloud data services and infrastructure are well-placed to focus on data reliability.

Data Architects: They design data systems and can emphasize reliability in their architectural decisions, though their role is often more strategic than hands-on.

Analytics Engineers: While their primary focus is on making data usable for analysis, they also deal with data quality and pipeline reliability, making them candidates for focusing on data reliability.

Data Scientists and Data Analysts: While not their core responsibility, they rely heavily on reliable data for their analyses and may contribute to data reliability initiatives, especially in smaller teams or organizations.

BI Professionals: Similar to data scientists and analysts, BI professionals depend on reliable data for reporting and might be involved in data reliability efforts to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of reports.
