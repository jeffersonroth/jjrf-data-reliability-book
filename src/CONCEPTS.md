# Concepts
>
> The first part of this book exposes the different concepts around the data reliability engineering subject. It's intended to be heavily technical, in contrast with the subsequent parts, crafted to explore practical use cases.

## [Introduction to Systems](./concepts/systems_intro.md) and [Systems Reliability](./concepts/systems_reliability.md)
>
> These chapters explore the concepts of systems, reliability, and how to understand systems reliability, especially its impediments, attributes, and mechanisms to design and maintain reliable systems.

## [Data Architecture](./concepts/data_architecture.md)
>
> This chapter explores in depth concepts of data architecture, including its sources, its storage (Data Lake, Data Warehouses, Data Marts), its application (OLAP servers, processing engines), and its presentation (dashboards, reports).

## [Data Quality](./concepts/data_quality.md)
>
> This chapter explores the concepts of data, quality, and data quality, to finally explore the concepts of data reliability. The goal is to understand these concepts in all aspects of the data: life cycle, design, modeling, governance, management, access, security, uses, legal frameworks, best practices, maturity, standards, etc.

## [Processes](./concepts/processes.md)
>
> This chapter explores, for a given system, the concept of data processes, data and information flow, workflows, orchestration, pipelines, ETL, and ELT.

## [Operations](./concepts/operations.md)
>
> This chapter explores the concept of SRE, DataOps, DevOps, Agile methodologies, CI/CD, and other methodologies to ensure reliable data operations.
