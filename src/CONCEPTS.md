# Concepts
>
> The first part of this book exposes the different concepts around the data reliability engineering subject. It's intended to be heavily technical, in contrast with the subsequent parts, intended to explore practical use cases.

## [Introduction to Systems](./concepts/systems_intro.md) and [Systems Reliability](./concepts/systems_reliability.md)
>
> These chapters explore what are systems, what is reliability, and how to understand systems reliability, specially its impediments, its attributes, and mechanisms to design and maintain reliable systems. All this for general systems, data systems, and data products.

## [Data Architecture](./concepts/data_architecture.md)
>
> This chapter explores what is data architecture, including its sources, its storage (Data Lake, Data Warehouses, Data Marts), its application (OLAP servers, processing engines), and its presentation (dashboards, reports).

## [Data Quality](./concepts/data_quality.md)
>
> This chapter explores what is data, what is quality, and what is data quality, to finally explore what is data reliability.
The goal is to understand these concepts in all aspects of the data: life cycle, design, modelling, governance, management, access, security, uses, legal frameworks, best practices, maturity, standards, etc.

## [Processes](./concepts/processes.md)
>
> This chapter explores, for a given system, the concept of data processes, data and information flow, workflows, orchestration, pipelines, ETL, and ELT.

## [Operations](./concepts/operations.md)
>
> This chapter explores the concept of SRE, DataOps, DevOps, Agile methodologies, CI/CD, and other methodologies to assure reliable data operations.
